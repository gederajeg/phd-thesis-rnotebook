  abstract = {Research on the relationship between grammatical aspect and motion event construal has posited that speakers of non-aspect languages are more prone to encoding event endpoints than are speakers of aspect languages (e.g., von Stutterheim and Carroll 2011). In the present study, we test this hypothesis by extending this line of inquiry to Afrikaans, a non-aspect language which is previously unexplored in this regard. Motion endpoint behavior among Afrikaans speakers was measured by means of a linguistic retelling task and a non-linguistic similarity judgment task, and then compared with the behavior of speakers of a non-aspect language (Swedish) and speakers of an aspect language (English). Results showed the Afrikaans speakers' endpoint patterns aligned with Swedish patterns, but were significantly different from English patterns. It was also found that the variation among the Afrikaans speakers could be partially explained by taking into account their frequency of use of English, such that those who used English more frequently exhibited an endpoint behavior that was more similar to English speakers. The current study thus lends further support to the hypothesis that speakers of different languages attend differently to event endpoints as a function of the grammatical category of aspect.

  shorttitle = {Metaphor and Metonymy Do Not Render Coercion Superfluous},
  abstract = {The present article challenges the claim that the notion of coercion, as understood in Construction Grammar(s) (henceforth CxG), is superfluous and can simply be accounted for in the light of metaphoric and metonymic extension in general (Ziegeler, Journal of Pragmatics 39: 990-1028, 2007, Constructions and Frames 2: 33-73, 2010). Specifically, coercion will be argued to be of pivotal importance to account for the semantico-pragmatic and discourse-functional properties of the family of the English subjective-transitive construction, understood as a web of interrelated form-function pairings (Gonzálvez-García, Language Sciences 31: 663-723, 2009b). Two substantive broad-scale generalizations emerge from the theoretical discussion as well as the cursory bottom-up, data-driven analysis on which this article draws. First, although the phenomenon of the interpretation of slot-determined meaning may involve metaphor and metonymy, a descriptively and explanatorily adequate account of the kinds of type-shifts allowable in the family of the subjective-transitive construction in English requires us to posit a variety of lower-level (verb-class or verb-specific) subconstructions, which vitiate a general-purpose metonymy-based account. Crucially, these constructions do not appear to be amenable to an explanation in terms of metaphor or metonymic extension alone, thus pointing to the inevitability of retaining coercion as well as constructions as free-standingtheoretical entities. Second, it is proposed that the phenomenon of coercion should be understood in terms of a continuum, that is, as a scale representing the extent to which a type of coercion is entrenched and conventionalized (Langacker, Cognitive Linguistics 20: 167-176, 2009) rather than as an allor-none property leading to a full matching or, by contrast, a semantic conflict between specific lexical items and constructions. Thus, what actually needs to be refined is the notion of the (degree of ) semantic (in-)compatibility between lexical items and construction meaning. At a higher level of granularity, it is further suggested that the notion of coercion be treated in terms of a continuum at a vertical or intra-constructional level, that is, within items of the same paradigm as well as a horizontal or inter-constructional level, among different instances, including lower-level configurations of the same construction.

Such expressions are used metaphorically when they convey pain experiences that do not directly result from physical damage (e.g., migraine pain). In this paper, I discuss psycholinguistic and neuroscientific research that suggests that these uses of metaphor may facilitate some form of embodied simulation of pain experiences on the part of listeners/readers, which may in turn provide the basis for an empathic response. I suggest that different kinds of metaphorical descriptions of pain vary in terms of their potential for eliciting a response involving embodied simulation, and in terms of the nature and intensity of the simulation they may elicit. I argue that the most relevant characteristics of metaphorical descriptions of pain in this respect are their level of detail, degree of creativity, and textual complexity.},

The data for this study came from two sources, namely, field notes from participant observations taken of naturally occurring interactions in the public and private spheres from August to December of 2008 and semi-structured interviews conducted with Shona speakers of varying age groups, educational status, religious and political affiliation, and gender. This article considerably draws analytical insights from the Cognitive Grammar (CG) framework which looks at metaphor as a conceptual and linguistic phenomenon that involves a mapping relation between two domains, namely, the source domain and the target domain. This theory argues that metaphor, as a cognitive tool enabling us to draw on our previous experience of the world with familiar issues and mapping them on less familiar ones, occupies a prominent place in our thought process.},

By using the new findings the paper examines two models of the sense-modality hierarchy proposed by Viberg (1984, 2001). In addition, this study also reports on two peculiar lexical semantic classes, i.e., 'elaborate taste verbs' and 'food texture verbs', attested in G∣ui and G∥ana, in which TASTE potentially plays an important role. The findings of this study have some theoretical implications for lexical typology since they show a subtle interaction between universal and language-specific factors.},

It is found that 1+2 is overwhelmingly disfavored in [N N] and 2+1 is overwhelmingly disfavored in [V O]. In addition, it is found that apparent exceptions, ranging between 1 and 2\%, are limited to certain specific structures, and when these are factored out, both 1+2 [N N] and 2+1 [V O] are well below 1\% in either token count or type count. The result bears on several theoretical debates, such as the validity of word-length preferences in Chinese, the motivation of the preferences, the extent and the nature of exceptions, and the interaction among syntax, semantics, and phonology.},

Twenty-three lexical verbs were searched for in three 100,000-word corpora of argumentative essays written in English by American, Filipino and Spanish university students. Concordance lines were examined to determine their use in the three corpora. After presenting the overall results for all verbs studied, more in-depth linguistic analysis was performed on the polysemous verb feel. These analyses revealed that the non-native writers, unlike their native counterparts, had a limited grasp of the full range of meanings of lexical verbs such as feel. It also showed that all student writers under study employed only a restricted range of lexical verbs to convey modal meanings in their writing. (English)},

  abstract = {The study discusses the use of reflexive pronouns as markers of middle situation types and questions the traditional generalization that only light or weak reflexives (e.g., German sich, Spanish se) appear as such markers. Based on an analysis of approximately 2000 examples drawn from the British National Corpus, it explores if and to what extent the English heavy reflexive itself can be found in such contexts. Moreover, it provides a typology of the middle situation types in which the form itself occurs and analyzes the processes that give rise to the use of itself in such contexts. While some incipient grammaticalization processes can be found, the study argues that self-intensification as well as various lexicalization processes need to be considered, too. It also provides an extensive quantitative analysis of the contexts in which itself occurs. The study concludes that morphologically complex or heavy reflexives can occur as markers of middle situation types, contrary to widely accepted accounts. Moreover, it argues that the traditional grammaticalization account given for the occurrence of reflexive pronouns as markers of middle situation types is too simplistic and needs to be revised.},

An expert within the business context provided expertise in the interpretation of specific types of data derived from the corpus. The findings show that the metaphorical linguistic expressions generally concretise the abstract concept of the economy and market movements and mainly comprise of verbs and nouns. This paper illustrates some of the examples of the relevant metaphorical expressions and discusses how the domain of PHYSICAL MOVEMENTS helps to structure the domain of market movements. The findings of this study, however, can only be generalised to the samples involved in this study.},

A vast body of typological, contrastive, and psycholinguistic research has shown the potential, but also the limitations of the original distinction between verb-framed and satellite-framed languages. This volume contains ten original papers focusing specifically on the variation and change of motion event encoding in individual languages and language families. The authors show that some of the central claims about motion event encoding need careful re-examination and reformulation and that individual languages and language families are more variable across space and time than even a refined typology could neatly capture at this time. The volume thus contributes to a more detailed and fine-grained foundation for the investigation of conceptual causes and consequences of different motion-event encoding strategies.},

Is the English language being corrupted by texting and social media? Do the kids today even care about good writing? Why should any of us care?     In The Sense of Style, the bestselling linguist and cognitive scientist Steven Pinker answers these questions and more. Rethinking the usage guide for the twenty-first century, Pinker doesn’t carp about the decline of language or recycle pet peeves from the rulebooks of a century ago. Instead, he applies insights from the sciences of language and mind to the challenge of crafting clear, coherent, and stylish prose.     In this short, cheerful, and eminently practical book, Pinker shows how writing depends on imagination, empathy, coherence, grammatical knowhow, and an ability to savor and reverse engineer the good prose of others. He replaces dogma about usage with reason and evidence, allowing writers and editors to apply the guidelines judiciously, rather than robotically, being mindful of what they are designed to accomplish.     Filled with examples of great and gruesome prose, Pinker shows us how the art of writing can be a form of pleasurable mastery and a fascinating intellectual topic in its own right.},

  abstract = {This paper deals with different theoretical aspects of lexical variation and change. More exactly, I will focus here on the analysis of some of the different ways lexical and non-lexical linguistic variation can interact over long periods of time. My analysis is based on the Functional-Lexematic Model, which conceives the lexicon of a language as a grammar. Its central unit of description is the word, which appears with all its syntactic, morphological, semantic and pragmatic properties. Macrostructurally, predicates are interconnected by cohesive, associative and encyclopaedic functions, forming what has been called the "semantic architecture of the lexicon." I will deal here with three basic concepts of lexical analysis and their applications to the historical vocabulary of English: (1) word-frequency, (2) syntactic variation and (3) lexical productivity. I will argue that the relative position of an Anglo-Saxon lexeme within the semantic architecture of OE can be calculated in terms of-at least-the following three different types of variation: onomasiological, syntactic and morphological-derivational. Since defining a verb means locating it in semantic space, the resulting hierarchical ordering into lexical domains and subdomains implies a reliable reconstruction of the mental lexicon of the Anglo-Saxons. In doing so, I will try to show how these easily observable variational phenomena can be used in order to compensate for the shortcomings of historical lexicology and semantics.},

  shorttitle = {Underspecification in the Semantics of Word Formation},
  abstract = {This article analyzes a case of Italian word formation in which the semantics of the derived words appears to contain mutually exclusive ambiguities. Italian productively derives verbs of removal from nouns. These verbs have the general semantic form A removes X from Y. There are two subtypes that differ in whether the nominal base is taken to be the or the : scremare ‘to skim’ ( crema ‘cream’) is a verb, and scarcerare ‘to release from prison’ ( carcere ‘prison’) is a verb. Current analyses are at a loss to give a uniform account for the semantics of derivational processes of these two kinds. In this article, such an analysis is proposed. It is based upon the model of lexical semantics known as two-level semantics. Two-level semantics makes a distinction between a layer of meaning, which is defined by grammar, and a level of interpretation, which is based upon conceptual knowledge. We propose that the derivation of Italian denominal verbs of removal of both types starts from a single underspecified representation, which is then specified at the conceptual level; depending on the concept type of the base, the denominal verb is either a verb or a verb. This study is an example of how the semantics of language-specific morphology may be embedded in cognitive structure.},

It opens with an introduction discussing Greenberg's work at length and a full bibliography of his publications.

constructed to provide data for the study of the Indonesian language and 
which could be of use in areas such as language planning, linguistics, applied 
linguistics and computational linguistics. Because corpus linguistics is still not 
well established in Indonesian linguistic circles, it presents an overview of what 
a corpus is, and of corpus typologies suitable for such a purpose. It then goes 
on to look at the essential features that such a corpus should have for it to be 
maximally useful for such a purpose. The most important issues are how large 
the corpus should be, and how it should be planned so that its composition 
was representative of the Indonesian language as a whole. It also deals with 
the issue of copyright. The construction of such a corpus would be of huge 
benefit to many, but it is a massive undertaking and one that would require 
the involvement of a large number of experts in different areas. It is hoped 
that this simple essay can mark the beginning of a consensus that would help 
make it a reality.

  shorttitle = {Cultural {{Translation}} and {{Linguistic Metaphor}}},
  abstract = {Research in metaphor translation, especially in literary discourse, might reveal a number of linguistic and cultural subtleties between the source and target languages. The present article investigates the peculiarities of verbal metaphor translation, in particular, what translation patterns and strategies dominate and whether the original metaphoric expression, together with its possible cultural specificity, is retained. The theoretical part of the paper draws on the Cultural Turn trend in Translation Studies, especially Venuti's (1995) ideas on cultural translation and Marcinkevičienė's (2006) and Deignan's (2005) definitions of linguistic metaphor. Marcinkevičienė (2006, p. 109) identifies collocations as a specific linguistic form of a cognitive metaphor, whereas Deignan (2005, p. 145-148) views linguistic metaphor as a part of speech grouping it into verbal, noun and adjectival collocations. The analyzed data (68 verbal metaphors), were taken from a novel "Belaisvis" (1993) by Skomantas, and its translation into the English language "The Captive" (1997), by Mara Almenas. The data was grouped according to the occurring translation patterns looking whether the metaphoricity of expression was retained, the syntactic structure preserved and words translated by their lexical equivalents. Next, different strategies used for verbal metaphor translation were identified to see how they correlate with the detected translation patterns. It appeared that the focus in verbal metaphor translation is on transferring the meaning rather than form; therefore, lexical and syntactic changes occur. Most often, metaphoricity, syntactic structure and abstract noun of the original collocation are preserved, whereas Lithuanian verb tends to be translated by a non-equivalent (in terms of dictionary meaning) English verb. Such dominant strategy of partial adaptation results in connotational differences between the Lithuanian and English metaphors. Finally, the fact that original metaphor often undergoes changes or is not preserved at all supports Venuti's (1995) claims about the prevailing domesticating literature translation techniques which hide the foreign identity of the text by adapting it to the cultural and linguistic norms of the dominant target culture.

  abstract = {Children's early production typically favors prototypical groupings of temporal-aspectual features; children prefer to say telic, perfective, past combinations (e.g., broke) and atelic, imperfective present combinations (e.g., riding). The current experiments examine the extent to which adults also favor these prototypical groups in a comprehension task (Experiment 1) and a sentence comparison task (Experiment 2). The results show that, like children, adults find prototypical combinations easier to understand, particularly in low-information contexts. Moreover, adults judge prototypical combinations as better sentences than nonprototypical sentences. The results are argued to support continuity in aspectual representations. The differences between children and adults is linked to the proposed origin of the prototypes themselves, namely, information processing demands.},

The major thrust of Greenberg's work in the past three decades has been in the fusion of these two approaches to linguistic explanation into one, diachronic typology, the cross-linguistic analysis of languages as dynamic systems.This volume honors Greenberg on the occasion of his 75th birthday. It opens with an introduction discussing Greenberg's work at length and a full bibliography of his publications. It contains ten papers in typology, diachronic theory and diachronic typology by some of the leading linguists working in the research tradition inspired by Greenberg's work.},

So, what we want to do is clear it automatically.  So what we actually have to do is go to the store and you can also get here by going to chrome.google.com/webstore and do a search for click and clean.  No what we want to do is we want to add this extension here.  You can add the app as well, but all I'm going to do is add the extension because that's all I need so I'm going to install the extension.  Click on install add it.  And then we can close out of this.  And you can see there's an icon here.  Again, I'm going to open Chrome and show you history and we've got history here and if I go here and hit options check this box and close that and close that and now if I go back in here under history and there's nothing there.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we bring to the attention of the linguistic community recent research on heritage languages. Shifting linguistic attention from the model of a monolingual speaker to the model of a multilingual speaker is important for the advancement of our understanding of the language faculty. Native speaker competence is typically the result of normal first language acquisition in an environment where the native language is dominant in various contexts, and learners have extensive and continuous exposure to it and opportunities to use it. Heritage speakers present a different case: they are bilingual speakers of an ethnic or immigrant minority language, whose first language often does not reach native-like attainment in adulthood. We propose a set of connections between heritage language studies and theory construction, underscoring the potential that this population offers for linguistic research. We examine several important grammatical phenomena from the standpoint of their representation in heritage languages, including case, aspect, and other interface phenomena. We discuss how the questions raised by data from heritage speakers could fruitfully shed light on current debates about how language works and how it is acquired under different conditions. We end with a consideration of the potential competing factors that shape a heritage language system in adulthood.},

  shorttitle = {The {{GET}} Constructions of {{Modern Irish}} and {{Irish English}}},
  abstract = {In this paper we explore from a synchronic perspective the GET construction of Modern Irish and the GET construction in the contact language Irish English. These productive GET constructions have two core senses ('HAVE' and 'BECOME'). There are no morphosyntactic indicators to identify either sense yet a language user of Irish or Irish English will have no difficulty unpacking the correct meaning. There is a constructional indicator. One sense is that of a simple recipient construction (non-passive) whereas the other is more passive-like in that the subject=undergoer of the construction undergoes a change of state. A result state is an outcome of the verbal action but it is not always expressed with a resultative adjective. The state is elaborated by the second argument of the verb. In functional models of grammar we expect the verb to project an argument structure and reflect an associated semantics based on the verb's lexical entry but we provide instances where a constructional perspective seems best to explain the behavior of this particular GET verb and its meaning in a clausal construction. We claim that the GET construction of Irish English and the GET construction of Modern Irish are related within a synchronic perspective, reflecting a unique cognitive perspective on bilingual lexicon architecture and the role of constructions. We provide an account of both language constructions and argue that a characterization grounded within functional account (Van Valin 2005) with a robust lexical constructional perspective (Goldberg 1995; Michaelis 2006; Van Valin 2005; Nolan 2011c), that mediates the relationship between lexicon and construction, best explains the relationship between these constructions across the two languages.},

There were differences across newspapers, with 1 in 8 Muslims describing it as extreme in The People while this figure was 1 in 35 for The Guardian. Such patterns of quantification, however, still require researchers to carry out their own critical interpretations with regard to what counts as acceptable frequencies.},

  abstract = {This research1 evaluates the extent to which lexical diversity, measured by frequent content words, hapax legomena, and type-token ratios (TTRs), is dependent on three features of the genre of the oral Indo-Aryan cultic poetry represented by the literary corpus of the Ṛgveda (ca. 165,000 tokens): characteristic choice of subject matter, usage of refrains, and the attribution of hymns to distinct poetic collectives. Analysis of 255 texts of 200 tokens showed that hymns on popular topics and where refrains were attested have a significantly higher rate of high-frequency content words and a lower ratio of once-occurring types. A higher TTR is observed in the hymns of specific family origin. Complexity of genre can be interpreted as a result of different discourse strategies of the poets. Overall, conservative mythological texts are characterized by regularity in word usage. Occurrence of content words, in the entire corpus, with lexemes denoting ‘deities’ on the one side and ‘nature’ on the other is accounted for by the factor of semantics, which deals with the structure of narrative.},

  abstract = {Part of a special issue on cognitive approaches to figurative language.  The aim of this article is to apply a long held theory of cognitive linguistics, namely the interdependence of meaning and form, to the study of conceptual metaphors.  This has yet to be done in any rigorous manner and the current study demonstrates that it is a task well overdue.  Although the investigation posits important theoretical arguments for “cognitively informed” studies of metaphor, the discussion bases its analysis in two established conceptual domains, LOVE and ANGER.  The discussion begins by demonstrating weaknesses in the current study of conceptual metaphors based solely on the lexicon. This is done through a brief investigation of the figurative language of ANGER.  The investigation then moves to resolve this issue by applying the study of morpho-syntax to conceptual metaphor analysis. Through the application of formal enquiry to the analysis of the domain LOVE, the discussion demonstrates two important points. Firstly, that morpho-syntactic study helps resolve problems of domain membership and delineation in cross-reference mapping of conceptual metaphors.  Secondly, the study reveals that metaphors possess a “grammatical topology.”  This topology, or character, is part of the conceptual makeup of the domain that is undetectable in purely lexical analyses.

  abstract = {In this paper, I consider whether the theory of bisociation, the sudden shift from one script (or narrative outline), or language mode or register to another, first developed in relation to joke humor, can help shed light on other forms of laughter-talk (defined as the talk preceding and provoking, intentionally or otherwise, an episode of laughter), particularly that observed in one form of (semi-)spontaneous discourse, namely White House press briefings. Two corpora of briefings transcripts were compiled, one from the Democrat era and one from the subsequent Bush administration, and the laughter bouts, along with their contexts and information on speaker and audience kinesics, were collected and transferred into separate laughter files. Not only was it found that several different forms of bisociation play an important role in briefings laughter-talk, but also that these forms are employed to attempt to achieve an intriguing variety of particular rhetorical argumentative aims, from criticizing the President to threatening an opponent's face to winning audience affiliation. Corpora have only rarely been used to investigate participants' interaction in discourse and still less in studies of laughter-talk or humor interaction. This paper, therefore, is intended as a contribution to the nascent interdisciplinary field of Corpus-Assisted Discourse Studies (CADS).},

It also discusses major structural aspects of nineteenth-century English, such as nouns, verbs and adjectives, and Germanic vs. Romance vocabulary. Although the nineteenth century is often viewed as a relatively stable period in the development of the language, this volume shows the 1800s to be a time of significant change, some of which continued into the twentieth century. By making comparisons possible with both earlier and later periods, it makes an important contribution to our overall understanding of the history of the English language.},

  abstract = {The aim of this study is to test whether balanced English–Spanish bilingual speakers behave like monolinguals in each of their languages when describing and remembering complex motion events. The semantic domain in question is motion, because some components (namely the manner of motion) are more difficult to lexicalize in Spanish than in English because of typological constraints (see Filipović, 2007; Slobin, 1996, 1997; Talmy, 1985). As a result, performance on a recognition task involving motion verbs could be expected to vary depending on the language used in the experiment. English and Spanish monolinguals and bilinguals performed the recognition task. Results from the monolinguals indicate that there is a language effect based on this typological difference. Specifically, English monolingual speakers performed significantly better than their Spanish peers in the recognition task in both of our conditions, i.e., with verbalization and without verbalization. The bilingual results on the other hand strongly suggest that these speakers tend to adhere to a single lexicalization pattern that is acceptable in both languages, which is the Spanish one in this case. We discuss further implications of these results for language processing and for memory of motion events in general.},

  abstract = {It has been long noted that Spanish does not license the use of manner verbs when describing telic motion events, particularly when they involve boundary crossing (Aske, 1989; Slobin \& Hoiting, 1994). The only exception to this constraint seems to be punctual acts, especially vertical boundary crossing situations, such as tirarse a la piscina (lit. 'throw oneself into the pool') (Naigles et al., 1998). Slobin (2004, 2006) has pointed out the low salience of manner in Spanish; the Spanish manner verb lexicon is not as extensive and frequently used as that of high manner salient languages like English, and as a result Spanish speakers are thought to attend less to manner than English speakers. In this study, we ask whether Spanish speakers would accept a manner verb in a boundary-crossing event, when manner of motion is made highly salient, either by contextual or by cultural means. Our research, though still preliminary, suggests both contextual manner salience and cultural manner salience increase the acceptability of Spanish manner verbs in boundary-crossing situations.},

  abstract = {This article attempts to lay the conceptual foundations of voice phenomena, ranging from the familiar active/passive contrast to the ergative/antipassive opposition, as well as voice functions of sprit case-marking -- both transitive and intransitive constructions. We advance the claim that major voice phenomena have conceptual bases rooted in the human cognition of actions, which have evolutionary, properties pertaining to their origin, development, and termination. The notion of transitivity is integral to the study of voice as evident from the fact that the so-called transitivity parameters identified by Hopper and Thompson (1980) and others are in the main concerned with these evolutionary properties of an action, and also from the fact that the phenomena dealt with in these studies are mostly voice phenomena. A number of claims made in past studies of voice and in some widely-received definitions of voice are shown to be false. In particular, voice oppositions are typically based on conceptual -- as opposed to pragmatic -- meanings, may not alter argument alignment patterns, may not change verbal valency, and may not even trigger verbal marking. There are also voice oppositions more basic and wide-spread than the active/passive system, upon which popular definitions of voice are typically based.},

  note = {This study investigates how seven pre-service English teachers (PSETs) learned classroom language in a Classroom Discourse (CD) unit at Pahlawan University, Indonesia, and used it in sixteen microteaching and seven practicum lessons. Specifically, the research investigates the nature of classroom language taught in the CD unit, how the PSETs learned it and how they implemented it. The data for this case study research were collected in two phases, at the university and in regional schools. The data include a questionnaire, learning and teaching journals, videotaped and audiotaped lessons, interviews, and classroom observation. Seven PSETs, two university staff, and five supervising teachers took part in this research. The analysis of data is both quantitative and qualitative. A review of the literature links the nature of classroom language to theoretical perspectives on learning, which show the importance of language as a tool for mediating learning. It was found that the CD unit curriculum goals refer to scaffolding, yet classroom language taught in the unit focuses on eight Basic Teaching Skills (BTSs) and includes limited content on classroom interaction, including scaffolding. It was further found that PSETs learned classroom language taught in the unit in the form of expressions used for the eight BTSs. They learned to use these by observing other PSETs, and English teachers during the CD unit. They also used these expressions in microteaching at university and in lessons which they taught in the school-based practicum. In their lessons, the PSETs focussed particularly on the use of five of the eight BTSs, including three kinds of lesson management skills, explaining the lesson and asking comprehension check questions. Although the PSETs tended to use English in microteaching, there was a noticeable change to trilingual code switching in the practicum. Three kinds of scaffolding, prompting, extension and modelling were attempted. However, these were used unsystematically.},

  abstract = {This MA dissertation is concerned with a specific case of language contact in Australia. It investigates the effects of standardisation and the development of a writing system on the formerly solely oral language Diyari of South Australia, using documentation sources collected over a period of 110 years. One of the main findings is that a significant change occurred in both language attitude and language structure resulting from missionary influence and the introduction of literacy. Furthermore, a lack of morphological features in Diyari recorded for related languages puzzled the author of the last descriptive grammar of the language (Austin, 1981). As detailed in the dissertation, the results suggest that grammatical reduction due to language contact and standardization was the cause of these phenomena.},

  abstract = {Metaphor makes our thoughts more vivid and fills our communication with richer imagery. Furthermore, according to the conceptual metaphor theory (CMT) of Lakoff and Johnson (Metaphors we live by. University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 1980 ), metaphor also plays an important structural role in the organization and processing of conceptual knowledge. According to this account, the phenomenon of metaphor is not restricted to similarity-based extensions of meanings of individual words, but instead involves activating fixed mappings that reconceptualize one whole area of experience in terms of another. CMT produced a significant resonance in the fields of philosophy, linguistics, cognitive science and artificial intelligence and still underlies a large proportion of modern research on metaphor. However, there has to date been no comprehensive corpus-based study of conceptual metaphor, which would provide an empirical basis for evaluating the CMT using real-world linguistic data. The annotation scheme and the empirical study we present in this paper is a step towards filling this gap. We test our annotation procedure in an experimental setting involving multiple annotators and estimate their agreement on the task. The goal of the study is to investigate (1) how intuitive the conceptual metaphor explanation of linguistic metaphors is for human annotators and whether it is possible to consistently annotate interconceptual mappings; (2) what are the main difficulties that the annotators experience during the annotation process; (3) whether one conceptual metaphor is sufficient to explain a linguistic metaphor or whether a chain of conceptual metaphors is needed. The resulting corpus annotated for conceptual mappings provides a new, valuable dataset for linguistic, computational and cognitive experiments on metaphor.},

  abstract = {Spoken language data were collected from six adult second language (L2) English learners over a year-long period in order to explore the development of word polysemy and frequency use. The data were analyzed both quantitatively and qualitatively. In the first analysis, the growth of WordNet polysemy values and CELEX word frequency values were examined. For both indexes, significant growth was demonstrated from the 2 \textsuperscript{nd} to the 16th week of observation, after which values remained stable. Growth in word polysemy values also correlated with changes in word frequency, supporting the notion that frequency and polysemy effects in word use are related. A second analysis used the WordNet dictionary to explore qualitative changes in word sense use concerning six frequent lexical items in the learner corpus ( think,  know,  place,  work,  play, and  name). A qualitative analysis compared normalized frequencies for each word sense in the first trimester of the study to the later trimesters. Differences in the number of word senses used across trimesters were found for all six words. Analyses 1 and 2, taken together, support the notion that L2 learners begin to use words that have the potential for more senses during the first 4 months; learners then begin to extend the core meanings of these polysemous words. These findings provide further insights into the development of lexical proficiency in L2 learners and the growth of lexical networks.},

The introductory chapters include a shortcut to Bulgarian syntax; a discussion on current relevant linguistic theories which acknowledge the interconnection between verb meaning and the verb's morpho-syntactic realization; and an outline of the theoretical background. The book presents the grouping of the examined verbs according to the type of events they can lexicalize and the respective lexical representations suggested for each group. It also reports on the psycholinguistics experiments designed to test the adequacy of the proposed format. The book sheds light on the information which is lexically encoded in verbs, and should be especially useful to professionals in lexical semantics and natural language processing and those interested in the formal description of verb meaning.},

While cognitive linguists typically study the cognitive aspects of language, and linguistic anthropologists typically study language and culture, Language, Mind, and Culture is the first book to combine all three and provide an account of meaning-making in language and culture by examining the many cognitive operations in this process. In addition to providing a comprehensive theory of how we can account for meaning making, Language, Mind, and Culture is a textbook for anyone interested in the fascinating issues surrounding the relationship between language, mind, and culture. Further, the book is also a "practical" introduction: most of the chapters include exercises that help the student understand the theoretical issues. No prior knowledge of linguistics is assumed, and the material is accessible and useful to students in a variety of other disciplines, such as anthropology, English, sociology, philosophy, psychology, communication, rhetoric, and others. Language, Mind, and Culture helps us make sense of not only linguistic meaning but also of some of the important personal and social issues we encounter in our lives as members of particular cultures and as human beings.},

I present three studies that explore the degree to which semantic intuitions are grounded in the distributional representations of adjective-noun phrases, as well as provide insight into various linguistic phenomena by extracting unsupervised cues from these distributional representations. First, I investigate degrees of adjective modification. I contrast three types of adjectival modifiers – intersectively used color terms, subsectively used color terms, and intensional adjectives – and test the ability of different composition strategies to model their behavior. Next, I propose an approach to characterize semantic deviance of composite expressions using distributional semantic methods. I present a set of simple measures extracted from distributional representations of words and phrases, and show that they are more significant in determining the acceptability of novel adjective-noun phrases than measures classically employed in studies of compound processing. Finally, I use compositional distributional semantic methods to investigate restrictions in adjective ordering. Specifically, I focus on properties distinguishing adjective-adjective-noun phrases in which there is flexibility in the adjective ordering from those bound to a rigid order. I explore a number of measures extracted from the distributional representation of such phrases which may indicate a word order restriction. Overall, this work provides strong support for compositional distributional semantics, as it is able to generalize and capture the complex semantic intuition of natural language speakers for adjective-noun phrases, even without being able to rely on co-occurrence relations between the constituents.},

In such texts, the coexistence, and indeed the coalescence, of Scots and (Scottish Standard) English is one of the most important traits in their author's distinctive style. The aim is to assess whether the use of diminutive forms together with vocative ones may constitute a syntactic unit in which semantic and pragmatic values are mutually reinforced. In addition to a specially-compiled corpus of Stevenson's texts, the investigation will consider occurrences of the same structure in the imaginative prose section of the Corpus of Modern Scottish Writing, which will be used as a control corpus.

The morphemes are the following: a middle marker, a detransitivizer, and a marker characterizing a closed subclass of intransitive verbs. In this article, I propose an analysis that relates these three morphemes diachronically, and links them to a common source. My analysis is able to account for both the commonalties and differences among the three morphemes. In the article, I claim that the middle marker in Otomi emerged from the reanalysis of an old inflectional morpheme characterizing a subclass of intransitive verbs depicting activities performed by humans. This analysis has important theoretical implications for the understanding of middle voice morphemes, given that, up until now, reflexives have been the only well known source for the emergence of middle markers.},

  abstract = {The Natural Semantic Metalanguage (NSM) approach has a long track record in crosslinguistic lexical semantics (Wierzbicka 1992, 1996, 1999; Goddard 1998, 2006, 2008, 2011; Harkins and Wierzbicka 2001; Goddard and Wierzbicka 2002; Peeters 2006; Gladkova 2010; Ye 2007a, 2007b, 2010; Bromhead 2009, 2011; Wong 2005, 2010; and other works). It is therefore not surprising that it has a clear theoretical position on key issues in lexical semantic typology and a well-developed set of analytical techniques. From a theoretical point of view, the overriding issue concerns the tertium comparationis. What are the optimal concepts and categories to support the systematic investigation of lexicons and lexicological phenomena across the world's languages? To this question, the NSM approach offers the following answer: the necessary concepts can - and must - be based on the shared lexical-conceptual core of all languages, which NSM researchers claim to have discovered over the course of a thirty-five year program of empirical crosslinguistic semantics. This shared lexical-conceptual core is the minilanguage of semantic primes and their associated grammar. In addition, over the past 10 or so years, NSM researchers have developed certain original analytical constructs which promise to enhance the power and systematicity of the approach: in particular, the notions of semantic molecules and semantic templates. This paper sets out to explain and illustrate these notions, to report some key analytical findings (updated, in many cases, from previously published accounts), and to extrapolate their implications for the further development of lexical typology.},

  abstract = {This book provides explanations for the emergence of contact languages, especially pidgins and creoles. It assesses the current state of research and examines aspects of current theories and approaches that have excited much controversy and debate. The book answers questions such as: How valid is the notion of a pidgin-creole-postcreole life cycle? Why are many features of pidgins and creoles simple in formal terms compared to other languages? And what is the origin of the grammatical innovations in expanded pidgins and creoles - linguistic universals, conventional language change, the influence of features of languages in the contact environment, or a mix of two or more factors? In addressing these issues, the author looks at research on processes of second language acquisition and use, including simplification, overgeneralization, and language transfer. He shows how these processes can account for many of the characteristics of contact languages, and proposes linguistic and sociolinguistic constraints on their application in language contact. His analysis is supported with detailed examples and case studies from Pidgin Fijian, Melanesian Pidgin, Hawai'i Creole, New Caledonian Tayo and Australian Kriol, which he uses as well to assess the merits of competing theories of language genesis. Professor Siegel also considers his research's wider implications for linguistic theory.},

  url = {http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2cg0m6cq},
  abstract = {This paper discusses the impact of Indonesian language politics on the formation and consolidation of Indonesian national identity. Maier’s central argument is that Indonesia’s claim to have completely eradicated colonist language from that of the independent state is a myth. He contends rather, that the revolutionary fervor that drove the creation of a new language and national culture in Indonesia also contributed to the repression of the ongoing presence of Dutch in both its language and national infrastructure. Indeed, Indonesian leadership has endeavored since Independence to disregard both the state’s colonial antecedents, and ongoing Dutch physical and cultural presence in it. Indonesians have been extremely reluctant for instance to acknowledge that the basis of modern Indonesian was laid by Dutch scholars. Maier maps this linguistic foundation through the work of earlier Dutch students of Malay, such as Van Ophuijsen, Takdir Alisjahbana, Gerth van Wijk and De Hollander. He stresses moreover, that significant aspects of Takdirs scholarship may be found in the Standard Grammar of Indonesian, published in 1988 and used to this day. Dutch has also contributed grammatical structure and vocabulary to Indonesian; roughly 20\% of contemporary Indonesian can be traced back to Dutch words, and appear even in quintessential nationalist texts such as the October 1988 Pledge of Youth. They are unrecognized as such however, because few Indonesian speakers are aware of this linguistic history. Finally, Maier argues, Malay is accepted today by inlanders as Indonesia’s most inclusive language, only because colonial administrators and scholars deliberately encouraged its use as the official language of communication in the Indies. This chapter in Indonesian history has also been obscured.},

  shorttitle = {The {{Concepts}} of "War" and "Peace" in the {{Old Russian Language Picture}} of the {{World}}},
  abstract = {The article is devoted to evolution of systematic relations in the lexical system of the Russian language that is studied in the light of cognitive linguistics. The article discovers the origin of the "war" and "peace" concepts, their historical development in the Old Russian language picture of the world and peculiarities of their verbalization in the Old Russian language. The conditions for functioning of the words actualizing "war" and "peace" concepts are revealed in the Russian business texts of the 17th century. The author underlines the historical nature of the concept as the basic lingua-mental unit. The article covers transformations that the conceptual structure is exposed to in connection with the development of thinking in the course of historical process. The article depicts the ways those transformations are reflected in the lexical system of the Russian language. The war and peace lexemes serve as the example for considering the formation of the linguistic antonymic opposition. The dependence of lexical paradigmatics on historical cognitive-linguistic processes is shown. The research proves that the conceptual and lexical war - peace opposition is the result of formation of the corresponding abstract notions. The isomorphism of "war" and "peace" frame-structures revealed in valence characteristics of language representations of concepts in the 16th -17th century texts demonstrates that the representations of the late Middle Ages treat them as rather uniform notional formations being a pair of correlated subject-subject relationship principles, opposed on the basis of a number of attributes. At the same time there is a historically determined equipollent semantic opposition within the frameworks of which "war" and "peace" are treated as notions possessing their own positive attribute ('counter-action' and 'inter-action', accordingly). The privative semantic opposition ('peace' = not-war, absence of war') also represented in the contemporary Russian language picture of the world, is a new formation of the late Middle Ages and arises under the influence of changing social and economic priorities of the Medieval society that led to destruction of ancient Slavic ideas about the world as a ritual agreement.

These locational verbs express the Ground space in which the Figure can be found in relation to the Deictic Center. Dispositional verbs may also be used in locative descriptions, but only in restricted contexts, requiring the expression of a human agent to bring about the locative relation.},

The present article takes issue with this assumption and seeks to establish the conceptual framework for a more sophisticated discussion of homoiôsis. The article identifies eight crucial junctures at which homoiôsis stories can diverge. For all the variance of homoiôsis narratives, the category of imitation of the divine remains a useful analytical tool. The article supports this claim by a comparison of Platonic and Stoic narratives of homoiôsis. It established their distinctness and shows how the rhetoric of imitating the divine offers important linguistic markers that allow us to trace the transgressive potential of (ancient) theologies.},

  abstract = {This paper attempts to delineate the intersection of the Buddhist understanding of mind and cognitive linguistics by exploring conceptual metaphors at both micro and macro levels of the Heart Sutra, a pivotal Buddhist text. Taking a key Buddhist concept, EMPTINESS, to mean transcending the self, Buddhism may be misunderstood as promoting a view of the human mind as disembodied. Micro-level linguistic analysis, however, reveals a paradox between the central message of non-attachment to the body or to the sensations and the pervasiveness of lexical metaphors in the text involving sensori-motor experiences. Investigations of the overarching metaphors and oxymora at the macro-level, such as "FORM IS EMPTY" and "EMPTINESS IS FORM" suggest that Buddhism in fact bears some striking similarities to cognitive philosophy in its recognition of embodiment and categorization as key aspects of mind, whose figurative nature becomes comprehensible through EMPTINESS as a reflection of the dependent nature of all phenomena.

Previous research on narratives has focused primarily on stories that appear either in formal literature or in structured interviews; this essay focuses on stories that occur as an integral part of conversation. It extends recent work on metaphor comprehension to show how use and comprehension of stories in natural, informal conversations can be usefully analyzed in terms of perceptual simulations. Conversely, it extends previous work on storytelling to reveal the metaphorical element in many stories, and to emphasize the social (bonding through shared enjoyment) as well as informative and persuasive functions of storytelling.},

  abstract = {This investigation of crosslinguistic patterns in lexicon-grammar interaction looks at complex predicate data from four Asian languages (Mandarin Chinese, Hindi-Urdu, Japanese, Marathi). In these languages verbs whose basic meanings are HIT and EAT are used as operators in complex predicates: e.g., Mandarin dǎ yíge quántóu \{HIT a fist\} 'give a punch' versus chī yíge quántóu \{EAT a fist\} 'take a punch' or Hindi-Urdu raub mār- \{awe HIT\} 'intimidate' versus raub khā- \{awe EAT\} 'be intimidated'. We show that in Chinese, Hindi-Urdu, and Marathi the normal antonymy of paired CPs featuring these two operators disappears if the CPs themselves alternate with the monolexical heads of intransitive clauses provided those clauses are unaccusative.

  doi = {10.1007/s10781-012-9166-z},
  abstract = {When somebody speaks metaphorically, the primary meanings of their words cannot get semantically connected. Still metaphorical uses succeed in conveying the message of the speaker, since lakṣaṇā, a meaning-generating faculty of language, yields the suitable secondary meanings. Gaṅgeśa claims that lakṣaṇā is a faculty of words themselves. One may argue: 'Words have no such faculty. In these cases, the hearer uses observation-based inference. They have observed that sometimes competent speakers use the word w in order to mean s, when p, the primary meaning of w does not make any semantic sense. In all such cases, s is actually related to p. After having observed this, when the hearer hears the utterance of w, and realizes that w's primary meaning p is semantically unfit for the sentence-meaning, they infer on the basis of their prior observation that 'the competent speaker must mean s by uttering w'. Thus lakṣaṇā becomes a success.' This apparently well-argued reduction does not stand the critical examination; neither in Gaṅgeśa's framework, nor even in the general theory of language. For one can compose and interpret potentially infinite novel sentences based on lakṣaṇā while the observational inferences one can make are finite. Gaṅgeśa says very clearly that as far as the secondary meaning is concerned, no prior observation is required. This paper will argue that not only does language yield secondary meanings through lakṣaṇā, but it also restricts the use of secondary meanings; for one cannot mean just anything by saying something. Lakṣaṇā is a creative function with infinite potential within the limits set up by the language faculty.},

  abstract = {In the present article we are offering a corpus-based analysis of nu-drop in Russian verbs, the process whereby certain verbs with the suffix -nu- omit this morpheme in past tense forms. We will explore phonological, morphological and syntactic/semantic factors and show that inflectional and derivational morphology are the most important for nu-drop. Our study of the inflectional and derivational morphological categories yields a polarized general picture; the categories display either close to 100\% Ø-forms (i.e. forms without -nu-) or close to 0\% such forms, while no categories are in the middle of the scale. Moreover, a diachronic survey of the development between the 19th and 21st centuries indicates increasing polarization, insofar as increasing percentages of Ø-forms are attested among forms with high percentages of Ø-forms, whereas decrease is characteristic of forms with low percentages of Ø-forms.

  abstract = {Corpus linguistics has demonstrated that language-in-use involves repetition of fixed and semi-fixed multiword combinations. Language-in-use also involves the use of formulaic patterns that can run from one word to many words. Currently, much of the reported research focuses on lexical bundles. To find out how lexical bundles function across different disciplinary areas in universities, the analysis reported here started with the creation of a list of lexical bundles used in arts, commerce, law, and science (each made up of seven subject areas) in a corpus written academic English. The use of the bundles in each of these four disciplinary areas was analyzed and compared to published results of similar data. This process led to a short but powerful list of 21 four-word lexical bundles that occur across these four disciplines. The discussion of the results of this search for widely used lexical bundles leads to a consideration of challenges in taking lexical bundle data into the English for Academic Purposes (EAP) classroom. The challenges lead to suggestions (a) for teachers about working with word lists made up of multiword sequences and (b) for researchers about providing data that would be especially useful for EAP teachers and students.},

  shorttitle = {Grammar and Disciplinary Culture},
  abstract = {The present study provides a usage-based account of how three grammatical structures, declarative content clauses, interrogative content clause and as-predicative constructions, are used in academic research articles. These structures may be used in both knowledge claims and citations, and they often express evaluative meanings. Using the methodology of quantitative corpus linguistics, I investigate how the culture of the academic discipline influences the way in which these constructions are used in research articles. The study compares the rates of occurrence of these grammatical structures and investigates their co-occurrence patterns in articles representing four different disciplines (medicine, physics, law, and literary criticism). The analysis is based on a purpose-built 2-million-word corpus, which has been part-of-speech tagged. 

The analysis demonstrates that the use of these grammatical structures varies between disciplines, and further shows that the differences observed in the corpus data are linked with differences in the nature of knowledge and the patterns of enquiry. The constructions in focus tend to be more frequently used in the  soft  disciplines, law and literary criticism, where their co-occurrence patterns are also more varied. This reflects both the greater variety of topics discussed in these disciplines, and the higher frequency of references to statements made by other researchers. Knowledge-building in the  soft  fields normally requires a careful contextualisation of the arguments, giving rise to statements reporting earlier research employing the constructions in focus. In contrast, knowledgebuilding in the  hard  fields is typically a cumulative process, based on agreed-upon methods of analysis. This characteristic is reflected in the structure and contents of research reports, which offer fewer opportunities for using these constructions.},

  shorttitle = {Standing Divided},
  abstract = {The Mayan languages Tzeltal and Yucatec have large form classes of dispositional roots which lexicalize spatial properties such as orientation, support/suspension/blockage of motion, and configurations of parts of an entity with respect to other parts. But speakers of the two languages deploy this common lexical resource quite differently. The roots are used in both languages to convey dispositional information (e.g., answering how questions), but Tzeltal speakers also use them in canonical locative descriptions (e.g., answering where questions), whereas Yucatec speakers only use dispositionals in locative predications when prompted by the context to focus on dispositional properties. We describe the constructions used in locative and dispositional descriptions in response to two different picture stimuli sets. Evidence against the proposal that Tzeltal uses dispositionals to compensate for its single, semantically generic preposition (Brown 1994; Grinevald 2006) comes from the finding that Tzeltal speakers use relational spatial nominals in the Ground phrase the expression of the place at which an entity is located about as frequently as Yucatec speakers. We consider several alternative hypotheses, including a possible larger typological difference that leads Tzeltal speakers, but not Yucatec speakers, to prefer theme-specific verbs not just in locative predications, but in any predication involving a theme argument.},

  shorttitle = {How Grammatical and Discourse Factors May Predict the Forward Prominence of Referents},
  abstract = {One of the ways in which discourse coheres is by means of repeated reference to entities. Theoretical accounts of referential coherence propose heuristics for the interpretation of referential expressions, which are especially important when there is more than one potential antecedent. One of the most explicit accounts is provided by Centering Theory (Grosz et al., Computational Linguistics 21: 203–225, 1995). Using features such as grammatical status, expression type, and the referential relation with sentences still further back in the discourse, it produces a ranking of discourse referents in terms of forward prominence. We present two corpus studies of how these features, in combination with discourse topichood, help to predict referential continuations in actual discourse. In Study 1, we analyzed newspaper fragments in which he is preceded by a sentence presenting two male singular participants. The factors Grammatical Role (being a Subject), Backward Center Status and Discourse Topichood appear to increase the chance that a referent is the intended one for a potentially ambiguous pronoun, while Expression Type (noun or pronoun) makes no difference. In Study 2, the continuations for sentences with two referents differing on the same four factors were compared, assuming that the most prominent referent will reappear in the next sentence. The study reveals that Grammatical Role only affects the form of continuation: subject referents do not reappear more often, but when reappearing they are more often realized as pronouns. Backward Center Status increases the chance of subsequent references to a referent, and also decreases the chances for its competitor of being referred to again. Discourse Topichood has the same double effect. In conclusion, both global and local factors affect referential prominence, but in different ways.

In this article we argue that abstract, figurative senses of polysemous words are better retained when learners are given core senses as cues, because providing a core sense helps learners develop a “precise elaboration.” Results of a series of vocabulary experiments involving Dutch learners of English show that providing a core sense results in better guessing and long-term retention of figurative senses of polysemous words than not providing any cues or providing cues involving nonliteral senses.},

The corpus has been designed to provide a firm basis for the study of both the contemporary written Czech (a goal well attainable with the present resources) and the Czech language beyond the limits of contemporary written texts (a long‐term commitment including the building of a corpus of spoken Czech and diachronic and dialectal corpora). The work on the CNC project, now in the eighth year of its official existence, has resulted in the completion of SYN2000, a 100‐million‐word corpus of contemporary written Czech, the organization of the cores of spoken, diachronic, and dialectal corpora, and the finding of workable solutions to some general theoretical problems involved in the building of these corpora.},

  abstract = {The WSD community has long debated whether the criteria for representing polysemy in general purpose dictionaries meet the specific demands of sense disambiguation tasks. Concern is growing that pre-defined sense inventories might not adjust well to the needs of WSD, because word occurrences can rarely be paired with rigid sense classes in a one-toone fashion. A second cause for concern is the level of sense granularity adopted in conventional dictionary entries. Fine-grained distinctions can be useful for a dictionary user but complicate the design and evaluation of WSD systems in a way that is often unnecessary. As a result of these objections, many experts have voiced the opinion that dictionaries are not adequate sources of sense inventories for WSD. However, the problem of word sense overlaps can also be resolved by modifying the way in which dictionary entries are processed by WSD programs. This is the solution applied in the LACELL WSD system. The algorithm selects simultaneously two or more dictionary senses if the context does not allow sufficient discrimination between/among them. This article explains the underpinnings of such proposal, as well as discussing some advantages and disadvantages. (English)},

In the categorization, the vehicle in a metaphor activates the metaphor-relevant meaning, but suppresses the metaphor-irrelevant meaning. However, the relationships between the strength of activation/suppression and the factors that predict the categorization have not been sufficiently examined. In addition, the previous studies did not show the meaning process of topic in metaphor comprehension. Our two experiments examined the meaning process of both topic and vehicle in metaphor comprehension by using a priming method and a meaningfulness decision task. Our experiments revealed that only the highly interactive metaphor with highly conventional vehicle activates the metaphor-relevant meaning in the vehicle, but that all metaphors suppress the metaphor-irrelevant meaning. We also revealed that the topic both as metaphor-relevant meaning and as metaphor-irrelevant meaning is activated in metaphor comprehension.},

  abstract = {This study investigated second language (L2) lexical development in the spontaneous speech of six adult, L2 English learners in a 1-year longitudinal study. One important aspect of lexical development is lexical organization and depth of knowledge. Hypernymic relations, the hierarchical relationships among related words that vary in relation to their semantic specificity (e.g., Golden Retriever vs. dog vs. animal), are an important indicator of both lexical organization and depth of knowledge. Thus, this study used hypernymy values from the WordNet database and a lexical diversity measure to analyze lexical development. Statistical analyses in this study indicated that both hypernymic relations and lexical diversity in L2 learners increase over time. Additionally, lexical diversity and hypernymic values correlated significantly, suggesting that as learners' lexicons grow, learners have access to a wider range of hypernymy levels. These findings are discussed in relation to developing abstractness in language, extending hypernymic knowledge, and the growth of lexical networks.},

  abstract = {In Swedish declaratives, clause-initial NP Fin NP…strings are structurally ambiguous. Though the prefinite argument NP normally occupies the role of the subject, in some circumstances the interpretation OVS is preferred over the basic SVO word order. Thus, the initial NP can also be analyzed as a nonsubject, that is, as a direct or indirect object, the object of a preposition, a predicate noun, or a predicate adjective. In this article, the consequences of this ambiguity for the production of NP Fin NP…sequences are studied More specifically, the influence of word order, inflectional morphology, content factors, and anaphoric reference on the topicalization of nonsubject NPs in two written corpora are discussed. A necessary condition for the production of an OVS structure is that the NP Fin NP… string cannot be interpreted as an SVO structure. In the analyzed texts, formal markers have only a weak correlation with the occurrence of OVS sequences as compared to the effect of meaning. A further factor influencing the probability of an OVS order is the textual continuity of the nonsubject NP. Most of the topicalized nonsubjects in the corpora are NPs referring to an antecedent in the left context.},

  abstract = {In this article, we address the problem of how people understand predicative metaphors such as “The rumor flew through the office,” and argue that predicative metaphors are understood as indirect (or two-stage) categorizations. In the indirect categorization process, the verb (e.g., fly) of a predicative metaphor evokes an intermediate entity, which in turn evokes a metaphoric category of actions or states (e.g., “to spread rapidly and soon disappear”) to be attributed to the target noun (e.g., rumor), rather than directly evoking a metaphoric category as argued by Glucksberg's (2001) categorization theory. We test our argument using two experiments, namely, offline comprehension and online priming. The offline comprehension experiment showed that interpretation of predicative metaphors had greater overlap with words indirectly associated with the verb than those directly associated with the verb. The online priming experiment demonstrated that indirectly associated words were activated during predicative metaphor comprehension, but directly associated words were not. These results provide convergent evidence for our argument, and thus the psychological validity of two-stage categorization as a process of predicative metaphor comprehension was confirmed.},

We present an approach that uses corpus methods to bridge the gap between the textual content of a corpus (and, thus, the typically textual concerns of many branches of the humanities) and the geo-referenced database at the heart of a GIS. Using part-of-speech tagging to extract instances of proper nouns from a corpus, and a gazetteer to limit these instances to those representing place–names, a database of the places mentioned in a corpus can be created, visualized, and analysed using GIS technology. It is also possible to visualize the meanings associated with particular place–names, by building GIS databases on the collocation of place–names with particular semantic categories in their immediate context. In this way, we can create maps that visualize the geographical distribution of mentions of concepts such as war, government, or money in a particular data set. The approach cannot be entirely automated and some manual intervention is required. Nevertheless, the method is clearly valuable for the interpretation of spatial phenomena in text corpora.},

The idea that an elaborate formal system such as the noun class system in the Bantu languages of southern Africa has developed into a morphologically arbitrary system without any conceptual or semantic underpinning or purpose, has been shown to be misplaced. It has been argued that the Bantu noun class system is based on conceptual notions such as concreteness, attribution, spatial orientation, as well as abstractness. An unrelated empirical child language acquisition study has shown that Zulu children acquire the prefixes denoting the noun classes in their language in a very specific order. In this article, the findings of the theoretical cognitive interpretation of the Zulu noun class system, the order in which Zulu children acquire the noun classes of Zulu, and an empirical corpus-based study of adult spoken Zulu, are related to each other in order to answer the question whether the Zulu noun class system is a morphologically arbitrary system, or whether it is underpinned by conceptual notions. The results of this study show clearly that the Zulu noun class system is, in fact, grounded in conceptual notions such as prototypicality, frequency and ease of acquisition.},

  abstract = {Problem Statement: Using corpora is still in its infancy in foreign language classes in spite of its great benefits and potential to offer solutions to the various challenges in foreign language instruction both for teachers and learners. This partly stems from a lack of interest and practical knowledge about the pedagogic role that the corpora can play. There is a pressing need to convince teachers of the great benefits of corpora with empirical data. Purpose of Study: This research aims to explore the feasibility of using a corpus to help students differentiate between close synonyms which have similar meanings but cannot be substituted one for the other. Method: This is quasi-experimental research based on a pre and post-test (one shot design) design. To this end, participants were introduced to the Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA) and asked to refer to the corpus when deciding the appropriate close synonym in the 50 sentences given. Participants were also interviewed upon completion of the task with the COCA about their use of corpus. Findings and Results: The t-test showed that the use of corpus for deciding on close synonyms proved to be very effective as there was a statistically significant difference in participants? performance on the vocabulary portion of the pretest and post-test. Conclusion and Recommendations: The present paper suggests that corpora can be a very rich and effective source of empirical data both for teachers and students to make foreign language learning more meaningful and enjoyable. Providing learners more exposure to authentic examples, corpora can be utilized for pedagogic purposes from syllabus design to materials development. Yet, it needs to be integrated into language courses. Teachers should be made fully aware of what corpora offer for language teaching. (English)},

The hypothesis is supported by two empirical case studies of the Russian Locative Alternation verbs, based on the data from the Russian National Corpus: the unprefixed verb sypat' 'strew' (which does not have an aspectual partner) and the unprefixed verb gruzit' 'load' and its three perfective partners with the prefixes na-, za-, and po-. It is argued that metaphorical extensions of these Locative Alternation verbs have a strong relationship with elaborations (interactions between different constructions), on the one hand, and reduction (Locative Alternation constructions with a reduced or omitted participant), on the other. The results indicate differences in metaphorical behavior of different prefixes (even when they are used to form perfective partner verbs) and different constructions (some constructions are more often instantiated as metaphorical extensions than the other).},

  shorttitle = {The Coding of Topological Relations in Verbs},
  abstract = {This article examines the grammar, use and meaning of fifteen verbs used in the Basic Locative Construction (BLC) of Likpe a Ghana-Togo-Mountain language. The verbs fall into four semantic subclasses: (a) basic topological relations: t be.at, tk be.on, kp be.in, and fi be.near; (b) postural verbs: s sit, ny stand, fka hang, yma hang, kps lean, fus squat, and labe lie; (c) distribution verbs: kp be spread, heaped, and t be covered; and (d) adhesion verbs: m be griped, be fixed, mnkla be stuck to. Likpe locative predications reflect an ontological commitment to the overall topological relation between Figure and Ground and are not focused just on the Figure or the Ground. Various factors determine the choice of competing verbs for particular scenarios: animacy, nonindividuation of the Figure, permanency of the configuration and the speaker's desire to be referentially precise or to present stereotypical information. It is demonstrated that in situations where there is a choice, speakers tend to use the more general verbs (stereotype information). The implications of this tendency for the development of a language from a multiverb language using several verbs (e.g., 15) in its BLC to using only a small-set of verbs in its BLC, just as some of Likpe's neighbors have done, are considered.},

  abstract = {The study was conducted to see if the provision of implementing corpora on English relative clauses would prove useful for Iranian EFL learners or not. Two writing classes were held for the participants of intermediate level. A record of 15 writing samples produced by each participant was kept in the form of a portfolio. Participants' portfolios in both the experimental and the control groups were analyzed to spot patterned errors. Having diagnosed the errors, both groups were instructed on the use of English relative clauses. The participants in the experimental group were instructed using the corpora as printed materials. The control group, however, were instructed using explicit definition, discussion and exemplification. Then, both group participants' portfolios were returned and they were asked to self correct their misapplied relative clauses. Interestingly, both groups had improved significantly. Two Chi-square tests on the use of that and which were run before and after classroom procedures on both groups. The first one suggested similar performance for the two groups but the second one favored the experimental group. The study suggests that applying corpora is an effective way to make students aware of their errors which ultimately leads them to self correction.},

  abstract = {In this article, we make the case for corpus-based metonymy analysis and show that many interesting linguistic and statistical questions can only be answered byworking with real texts. To facilitate such studies, we present a method for annotating metonymies in domain- and genre-independent text. We advocate an annotation scheme that builds on regularities in metonymic usage, that takes underspecification in metonymic reference into account, and that is organized hierarchically. We combine previous metonymy classification proposals with insights from a corpus study to present a fullyworked-out annotation scheme for location names, illustrating the previously mentioned principles.We present several experiments measuring annotation agreement and show that the annotation scheme is reliable and has wide coverage. We also provide a gold standard for annotations of this kind consisting of 2,000 annotated occurrences of country names in the British National Corpus.We use the resulting corpus to study metonymy distributions and the factors that influence the choice of literal versus metonymic readings in real texts.},

A constructional analysis of the constructions will be proposed, as they pose licensing problems and their interpretation cannot be accounted for in terms of the individual conceptual structures of the lexical items composing the sentence. Unlike most accounts of verb particle constructions based on implicit or explicit assumptions of straightforward semantic composition, the present study proposes an analysis under which the semantic structure of verb particle combinations is not a compositional function of the verb and the particle/prefix alone. It is argued that the construction comes with its own subcategorization frame (separate from that carried by the verb) which is motivated by the meaning of the construction and its corresponding constructional subevent. Additionally, a crosslinguistic correlation will be shown to hold between a language\&rsquo;s ability to express event conflation (Talmy 1985, 2000) and the occurrence of some form of the construction in that language. This will be taken as an indication of the resultative nature of those types of directional phrases which involve the semantic interpretation of boundary crossing.},

  abstract = {Conventionality and aptness are two dimensions of metaphorical sentences thought to play an important role in determining how quick and easy it is to process a metaphor. Conventionality reflects the familiarity of a metaphor whereas aptness reflects the degree to which a metaphor vehicle captures important features of a metaphor topic. In recent years it has become clear that operationalizing these two constructs is not as simple as asking naive raters for subjective judgments. It has been found that ratings of aptness and conventionality are highly correlated, which has led some researchers to pursue alternative methods for measuring the constructs. Here, in four experiments, we explore the underlying reasons for the high correlation in ratings of aptness and conventionality, and question the construct validity of various methods for measuring the two dimensions. We find that manipulating the processing fluency of a metaphorical sentence by means of familiarization to similar senses of the metaphor ('in vivo conventionalization') influences ratings of the sentence's aptness. This misattribution may help explain why subjective ratings of aptness and conventionality are highly correlated. In addition, we find other reasons to question the construct validity of conventionality and aptness measures: for instance, we find that conventionality is context dependent and thus not attributable to a metaphor vehicle alone, and we find that ratings of aptness take more into account than they should.},

  shorttitle = {Cognitive Reference Points},
  abstract = {Psychologists have shown that reference-point reasoning is a ubiquitous cognitive phenomenon intrinsic to perception, categorisation, spatial orientation, social, organisational and marketing behaviour of human beings. Various cognitive tasks involve evoking a salient entity – called cognitive reference point – for establishing mental contact with less salient items. It is then reasonable to assume that language use also involves a lot of reference-point reasoning. However, linguistic aspects of this phenomenon have hardly been investigated. A welcome exception is Langacker’s reference-point model dealing with grammatical constructions and metonymy. 
 This thesis elaborates the reference-point model by applying it to lexical semantics. The only reference point that has been quite intensely studied in lexical semantics is a prototype. By focusing on two adjectival groups (colour and size), the author demonstrates that a whole panoply of cognitive reference points are used to anchor conceptual specifications of lexical items, prototypes being only a special case of the reference-point mechanism. An important finding is that a word may trigger more than one reference point at a time. For example, dimensional adjectives may be interpreted vis-à-vis an average value, endpoints of the scale, prototypes and dimensions of the human body. Contextual variability is claimed to be related to various combinations of reference points, their relative salience and patterns of interaction.},

The status of these languages in the typology of positional verb systems is considered, and other relevant typological generalizations are examined.},

  abstract = {It was long considered to be impossible to learn grammar based on linguistic experience alone. In the past decade, however, advances in usage-based linguistic theory, computational linguistics, and developmental psychology changed the view on this matter. So-called usage-based and emergentist approaches to language acquisition state that language can be learned from language use itself, by means of social skills like joint attention, and by means of powerful generalization mechanisms. This paper first summarizes the assumptions regarding the nature of linguistic representations and processing. Usage-based theories are nonmodular and nonreductionist, i.e., they emphasize the form-function relationships, and deal with all of language, not just selected levels of representations. Furthermore, storage and processing is considered to be analytic as well as holistic, such that there is a continuum between children's unanalyzed chunks and abstract units found in adult language. In the second part, the empirical evidence is reviewed. Children's linguistic competence is shown to be limited initially, and it is demonstrated how children can generalize knowledge based on direct and indirect positive evidence. It is argued that with these general learning mechanisms, the usage-based paradigm can be extended to multilingual language situations and to language acquisition under special circumstances.

Der vorliegende Aufsatz beginnt mit kritischen Überlegungen zum Begriff der Valenz und zu den Methoden der Valenzanalyse und untersucht anschließend anhand eines Korpus von ca. 150.000 Wörtern die Valenz einfacher Verben, die Valenz verändernde Funktion der Applikativpartikel und der sog. Dativpräposition sowie die Interaktion von verschiedenen Valenz verändernden Prozessen innerhalb eines einzigen Prädikates. Dabei decken die Valenz verändernden Prozesse die unterschiedliche semantische Rollenstruktur ditransitiver Verben auf.

Gleichzeitig werden Leistung und Grenzen des korpusbasierten Ansatzes deutlich.},

This paradox can be resolved by attending to one crucial aspect of metaphor in communication: the question whether metaphor is used as deliberately metaphorical or not. It is likely that most deliberate metaphor is processed metaphorically (by comparison), as opposed to most nondeliberate metaphor, which may be assumed to be typically not processed metaphorically (that is, by categorization). This resolves the paradox of metaphor because it suggests that all “metaphor in communication” (all deliberate metaphor) is processed metaphorically. Detailed comments are offered on the notion of metaphor deliberateness and on the nature of a three-dimensional model of metaphor in discourse involving metaphor in language, thought, and communication.},

It is argued that much of this criticism arises from common misconceptions as to the real claims made by the theory. However, CTM is still in need of further exploration and empirical support. In this connection, we identify some areas where research is still needed and supply our own developments. We argue for a more complex classification of metaphor types, which takes into account various complementary taxonomic perspectives, including the nature of source and target and the genericity and complexity of the metaphoric operation. We also explore metaphor in relation to cognitive prominence and conceptual interaction issues. Finally, we deal with the problem of constraints on metaphor and make a proposal for three complementary kinds of constraint.},

In the case of discourse markers and connective expressions, most research remains at a theoretical level, despite the increasing interest in the use of corpora for linguistic analysis in the last decades. We undertake a corpus-based analysis of the meaning and function of although, drawing on previous descriptions of this unit formulated from different theoretical perspectives (discourse analysis, pragmatics, semantics). We aim to contribute empirical evidence for certain claims made in the literature, and to complement such descriptions with our findings. The study focuses on the type of contrast expressed by although, the elements of the contrast relation and the structure of the information. First, the theoretical background for the particular issues we study is presented. Then, the objectives and methodology are explained, and results discussed. (English)},

An exploratory investigation comparing the use of these two online corpora in Japanese university writing classes is then described. This suggests that the participants in the study were able to significantly improve the naturalness of their writing after only a 90-minute training session and that the majority of students found these online resources beneficial, although there was a marked preference for the COBUILD Corpus and Collocations Sampler.},

  abstract = {The domain of space presents some interesting properties. On the one hand, spatial understanding by human beings is said to be universal and to share the same biological heritage; one the other hand, the linguistic systems encoding spatial knowledge vary strikingly. This paradox raises fundamental questions, including for language typology. In this context, the present study examines adults' expression of caused motion events in Chinese versus English in the frameworks proposed by Talmy, Toward a cognitive semantics, vol. 2: Typology and process in concept structuring, MIT Press, 2000 (i.e., verb-framed versus satellite-framed) and Slobin, The many ways to search for a frog: linguistic typology and the expression of motion events, Lawrence Erlbaum, 2004 (i.e., equipollently framed) regarding the expression of spatial information across languages. The results of a cartoon-based production task reveal that, although both languages tend to express equally frequently the same set of semantic components for motion (Path, Manner, Cause, etc.), Chinese greatly differs from English in terms of where this information is encoded and how it is distributed across utterances. On the basis of these findings, it is suggested that it is better to understand Chinese on its own merits: this language shows both satellite- and verb-framing properties, thus demonstrating a 'parallel' system.

Its focus is on the communicative role of these items, i.e., the way in which they are used by authors to communicate effectively with their readers. The analysis tries to combine a qualitative (discourse analytic) and a quantitative (corpus linguistic) perspective by making use of a small corpus containing the endings of 32 English and 32 German texts from the genre popular science. All deictic expressions present in the corpus were manually identified, counted and analyzed according to the function(s) they fulfill in their respective context. The results suggest that deictic expressions are more frequent in German than in English texts. Two (related) reasons seem to account for this finding: first, deictics figure more prominently in the German system of textual cohesion. Second, they were in many instances found to serve as an (optional) instrument for maximizing explicitness, a communicative strategy which is customary in German but not in English discourse.},

  abstract = {In the last decade, the availability of corpora and the technological advancements of corpus tools have increased dramatically. Applied linguists have greater access to data from around the world and in a variety of languages through websites, blogs, and social networking sites, and there is a high level of interest among these scholars in applying corpora and corpus-based methods to other research areas, particularly sociolinguistics.   This innovative guidebook presents a systematic, in-depth account of using corpora in sociolinguistics. It introduces and expands the application of corpora and corpus approaches and tools in sociolinguistic research, surveys the growing number of studies in corpus-based sociolinguistics, and provides instructions and options for designing and developing corpus-based studies. Readers will find practical information on such contemporary topics as workplace registers, megacorpora, and using the web as a corpus. Vignettes, case studies, discussion questions, and activities throughout further enhance students’ involvement with the material and provide opportunities for hands-on practice of the methods discussed. Corpus-Based Sociolinguistics is a comprehensive and accessible guide, a must-read for any student or scholar interested in exploring this popular and promising approach to sociolinguistic research.},

  shorttitle = {Productivity in {{Italian}} Word Formation},
  abstract = {The quantitative approach to morphological productivity first proposed by Baayen crucially refers to the relation between the number of hapax legomena formed with a given affix occurring in a sufficiently large corpus and the total number of tokens of that affix sampled in the corpus. Most criticism against this measure focuses on its neglecting the role played by frequency in the evaluation of productivity. As an improvement of Baayen's procedure, a variable-corpus approach is proposed. Accordingly, the productivity valves should be calculated at equal token numbers for different affixes instead of raking the different token numbers which result from sampling the whole corpus for all affixes, as in Baayen's works. This implies that variably-sized subcorpora must be sampled to compare affixes displaying different frequencies. On the basis of a 75-million-token newspaper corpus, the productivity values for several Italian affixes in the deverbal and deadjectival domain are calculated. The resulting rank proves linguistically plausible, avoiding the overestimation of productivity for low-frequency affixes typically occurring in fixed-corpus calculations. As a further advantage, the procedure proposed here makes it possible to deal satisfactorily with two problematic aspects usually neglected in previous investigations, namely, the quantitative impact of (i) allomorphies and lexicalizations and (ii) inner-cycle derivations on productivity measures.},

  title = {Happiness: {{A}} Definitional Effort},

  issn = {08857253},
  shorttitle = {Happiness},
  abstract = {The general purpose of this article is twofold: first, to characterize the concept of happiness, and second, to show what is involved in doing so. To accomplish these goals, a large part of this article is concerned with identifying the conceptual metaphors of happiness in the spirit of Lakoff and Johnson (1980). Lakoff and K/Svecses (1983) considerably improved on this analysis by showing how, in addition to the metaphors, metonymies also play a major role in the makeup of abstract concepts like anger, and by pointing out that the metaphors and metonymies converge on a prototypical cognitive model. This study goes beyond this latter framework in two ways: First, it is suggested that, in addition to the metaphors and metonymies, what is called inherent concepts are further important ingredients of some abstract concepts, like happiness. Second, it is claimed that, in the light of some current proposals in cognitive linguistics, happiness can be seen as having not one but several cognitive prototypes. It is expected that the conceptual framework outlined here for the analysis of happiness can be usefully extended to the study of other emotion concepts and, possibly, to abstract concepts in general.

  abstract = {In this paper we propose a new model for the analysis of complex word forms in Australian languages. We propose that complex words should be categorized in terms of their phonological patternings. We show that complex words exhibit two distinct types of phonological patternings. One type of complex word shows the same patterns as simplex words. We call morphological relations within this type of word, root-level relations. In the other type of complex word, at least one constituent itself has the characteristics of a simplex word. We call morphological relations within this type of word, word-level relations. We demonstrate that the distinction between root-level and word-level relations has clear correlates in morphological productivity. Our model provides a straightforward account of the relationship between phonology and morphology in complex words.},

  abstract = {This article discusses the semantics and pragmatics of postural, existential and positional verbs occurring in the basic locative construction of Goemai, a West Chadic language of Central Nigeria. The Goemai system is of special interest to the typology proposed in this issue, as it presents language-internal evidence for the existence of two different types of locative verbs: postural-type verbs and positional-type verbs. In most respects, Goemai patterns with postural-type languages: it has a small set of postural verbs that codes a limited range of semantic notions and that is used in both assertional and presuppositional ways. In addition, Goemai can recruit other verbs to occur in the basic locative construction: an existential verb that is available in many contexts where other postural-type languages tend to resort to the presuppositional use of posturals; and positional verbs that constitute a distinct form class and that can be used in an assertional way only. The article investigates the interaction of postural, existential, and positional verbs in Goemai, relating them to the proposed typology.},

In addition to versions of the papers presented at the workshop, the volume contains specially commissioned contributions, some of which offer commentaries on a subset of the other articles. The articles address a number of themes central to grammaticalization studies, such as the role of reanalysis and analogy in grammaticalization, the formal modelling of grammaticalization, and the relationship between formal and functional change, using data from a range of languages, and (in some cases) from particular electronic corpora. The volume will be of specific interest to historical linguists working on grammaticalization, and general linguists working on the interface between synchrony and diachrony.},

Across the various shapes taken on by the senses, this article will point out the Anglo–Saxon striking polarization of external and internal senses, and how this mirrors another important dichotomy related to one specific sense within Old English texts, that of the eyes of the body as opposed to those of the mind. Moreover, this study will show how the relationship between external and internal senses leads Anglo–Saxon scholars to a bivalent perspective of the bodily senses, considered positively as tools of enrichment and bearers of health, and at the same time negatively, as means of sinning.},

  abstract = {Research in cognitive linguistics and in processing of temporal metaphors has traditionally distinguished between Moving-Ego and Moving-Time mappings: Either the Ego is construed as moving regarding fixed temporal landmarks or Time is construed as moving regarding the Ego. Both of these metaphors involve time events in reference to an Ego, which specifies the present time Now.We build on recent theoretical suggestions for a more fundamental classification of temporal metaphors: Ego- and Time-Reference-Point metaphors (Ego-RP and Time-RP). The distinction focuses on the role of reference points in ascribing orientation, rather than on the identity of a moving entity (Ego or Time). Using visual priming experiments we provide evidence of the psychological reality of the Time-RP metaphor, a temporal metaphor with no reference to an Ego.

  abstract = {Each of us as language learners had different language experiences, yet somehow we have converged upon broadly the same language system. From diverse, often noisy samples, we have attained similar linguistic competence. How so? What mechanisms channel language acquisition? Could our linguistic commonalities possibly have converged from our shared psychology of learning as applied to the evidence of similar-enough language experience? This article outlines a research program to investigate whether there are sufficient constraints in the dynamics of language to promote robust induction by means of statistical learning over limited samples. It illustrates the approach with regard to English verbs, their grammatical form, semantics, and Zipfian patterns of usage. It explores the emergence of structure from experience using methods from cognitive linguistics, corpus linguistics, learning theory, complex systems, and network science.},

It also has spatial meanings that define the notion of 'under' more precisely. Besides this, pod- has various meanings that are either not only or not at all spatial. I claim that the common denominator of these meanings is the notion of domination. I have also defined the conceptual basis of domination as being both metaphorical and metonymical and have discussed the difficulties that we have had in differentiating between the two. As a result of having analysed 1,191 examples from a comprehensive dictionary, I claim that the conceptual metaphors and metonymies that are able to explain the use of the Russian prefix pod- are: important is up, less important is down; doing in secret is down; harmer is up, harmed is down; taking completely off a surface is down and getting abstractly closer is going down. These conceptualizations are submetaphors of the Domination Metaphor and they have further subcategories which are also discussed in this article. (English)},

  abstract = {Recent research has demonstrated an asymmetry between the origins and endpoints of motion events, with preferential attention given to endpoints rather than beginnings of motion in both language and memory. Two experiments explore this asymmetry further and test its implications for language production and comprehension. Experiment 1 shows that both adults and 4-year-old children detect fewer within-category changes in source than goal objects when tested for memory of motion events; furthermore, these groups produce fewer references to source than goal objects when describing the same motion events. Experiment 2 asks whether the specificity of encoding source/goal relations differs in both spatial memory and the comprehension of novel spatial vocabulary. Results show that endpoint configuration changes are detected more accurately than source configuration changes by both adults and young children. Furthermore, when interpreting novel motion verbs, both age groups expect more fine-grained lexical distinctions in the domain of endpoint configurations compared to that of source configurations. These studies demonstrate that a cognitive-attentional bias in spatial representation and memory affects both the detail of linguistic encoding during the use of spatial language and the specificity of hypotheses about spatial referents that learners build during the acquisition of the spatial lexicon.},

  abstract = {The article addresses the problem of the linguistic encoding of the locative roles of Goal and Source of motion. After discussing the typological patterns of marking static locations, goals, and sources of motion, I analyze data from Wan, a Southeastern Mande language that often does not encode the distinction between sources and goals either outside of the verb (by adpositions or case) or in the verb's argument structure. In addition to a class of specialized verbs that subcategorize for a particular type of locative argument (“source verbs” and “goal verbs”), Wan has a number of verbs that do not restrict their argument to either sources or goals. I show that the two verb classes contrast with respect to the amount of information about the direction of motion that is entailed by the verb's lexical meaning. In encoding the role of the locative argument, the two verb classes rely on different strategies: the semantic role is either encoded in the verb's argument structure, or inferred from the interaction of contextual information and the verb's lexical entailments. I demonstrate how the lexical entailments of motion verbs influence their subcategorization pattern and discuss crosslinguistic evidence that supports this analysis.

  title = {Recent Change in Modal Meanings: {{Evidence}} from Collocational Shifts},
  url = {http://www.isle3.uzh.ch/static/files/189.xml},
  abstract = {This talk addresses recent processes of change in the nine English core modals can, could, may, might, shall, should, will, would, and must. Given the rich literature on the topic, what is there that can be usefully added to the discussion? This talk will present a corpus-based study that diachronically tracks the collocational behavior of the English modals over the past 150 years. What are the lexical verbs that used to co-occur most frequently with modals such as shall and could in the 19th century, and which verbs do we find today? As will be shown, an analysis of this kind can capture observations that have been made regarding semantic change in modal auxiliaries, and these can be integrated into an analysis that also takes pragmatic and genre-related changes into account. The main claim of the analysis is that the most important aspects of recent change are to be found along two dimensions: the first of these is the dynamics of deontic and epistemic meaning; the second one is the contrast between involved and informational text types.

Methodologically, this paper draws on data from the COHA (Davies 2010). All nine core modals are diachronically analyzed with regard to the frequencies of collocating lexical verbs in the infinitive. For each modal, in each decade of the corpus, a frequency vector of the collocating verbs was created. These frequency vectors form the basis for a quantitative analysis. The motivation for using data of this kind is that modals that occur with similar sets of collocates at similar frequencies can be assumed to share semantic, pragmatic or genre-related characteristics. The set of frequency vectors is submitted to a multidimensional scaling analysis that allows a dynamic visualization (Hilpert 2011) of how the nine modals have changed diachronically.

The visualization of the quantitative changes allow several observations that reflect both diachronic stability and change. Certain modals, among them might and could, largely retain their collocational behavior. By contrast, the modal may shows a substantial diachronic shift that reflects an increasing propensity towards epistemic meaning (cf. Millar 2009). The modal shall, which diachronically retreats in terms of its text frequency, also changes its collocational behavior. Specifically, it shows a drift towards informational texts, which represent the genre in which shall continues to be used.

The empirical results will be used to raise a theoretical question, namely whether change in the English modals can be usefully seen as a case of constructional change (Hilpert 2013). Clearly, the English modals have formal and functional features in common that would be suggestive of viewing them as instances of an overarching modality construction (Diewald 2009). Individual diachronic changes in certain English modals do however point to the fact generalizations at lower levels of abstraction form an important part of speakers' linguistic knowledge.},

Positional verbs are defined as those verbs which may appear in the basic construction that functions as an answer to a where-question, the so-called Basic Locative Construction (BLC). Within this class of verbs, we focus on those positionals which are used to describe the configuration of inanimate movable objects. We will demonstrate that German exhibits the characteristics of a positional (or multiverb) language, i.e., a language that uses a comparatively large set of verbs in the BLC. The ten positionals used most frequently in our data are stehen stand, liegen lie, hngen hang, lehnen lean, stecken be in tight fit, be stuck, klemmen be stuck, be jammed, kleben stick by means of glue, haften adhere, schwimmen be afloat in liquid, and schweben be afloat. We will identify the conditions under which the positional verbs are used and provide a semantic characterization for each of them, paying particular attention to alternative categorizations, fuzzy boundaries and prototype effects.},

Sentence-ending participial clauses with the Main Clause, V+ing structure were most frequently found in both journal papers, with the proportion of 5.1 \% of sentences in Cell papers and 2.5\% in PRL papers. Verbs used in sentence-ending participial clauses represent the characteristics of each journal. The other types of participial clauses did not differ much in terms of frequency.

It is shown, accordingly, that the semantic structure of fixed expressions can be analysed in terms of the various cognitive mechanisms of construal, which can be observed throughout all kinds of language use. In line with the cognitive linguistic tenet that meaning is essentially dynamic conceptualisation, generated in the constructivist act of the interacting subject, both analysability and motivation are discussed as two basic notions of phraseological semantics. The application of Langacker's 'Current Discourse Space' implies the consequent inclusion of discourse elements as an essential component of an integrated, usage-based account of (phraseological) semantics. Finally, the paper offers an empirical perspective in the description of the creative variation of fixed expressions in two different types of (mini)texts: newspaper headlines and conversational humour.},

  abstract = {It was Lakoffian’s side stated metaphor as a mentally matter conceptualized structurally prior to linguistic expression. Among of the studies concerning with that conceptual metaphor are such as orientational metaphor, 
ontological metaphor, and structural metaphor. In application to the case of 
bahasa Mandailing, theoretical view of  orientational metaphor perceived ASCEND-DISCEND (NAIK-TURUN) respectively as one’s  luck and unluck, or something good and bad happened to anyone else is apparently 
contradictory. In bahasa Mandailing, anything indicated as ASCEND NAIK) in metaphors are not merely all perceived as something good or 
lucky. With so many orientational metaphors, in bahasa Mandailing, ascending matters are not always perceived as positive-valued things. Conversely, society of the language will perceive DISCEND (TURUN) or something reachable as positive-valued  things. As another characteristic to the language concerned is divisibility of  it’s metaphorical structure, i.e.  that it is possible for the other linguistic unit, in the kind of words, to be inserted between the metaphorical components.},

Although idiolects and sociolects are commonly used terms in the humanities, they have not been investigated a great deal from corpus and computational linguistic points of view. To test several idiolect and sociolect hypotheses a factorial combination was used of time period (Modernism, Realism), gender of author (male, female) and author (Eliot, Dickens, Woolf, Joyce) totaling 16 corresponding literary texts. In a series of corpus linguistic studies using Boolean and vector models, no conclusive evidence was found for the selected idiolect and sociolect hypotheses. In final analyses testing the semantics within each literary text, this lack of evidence was explained by the low homogeneity within a literary text.},

  note = {This study is a comprehensive description of the nominal demonstratives in Dalabon, a severely endangered Gunwinyguan non-Pama-Nyungan language of southwestern Arnhem Land, northern Australia. Demonstratives are attested in the basic vocabulary of every language, yet remain heretofore underdescribed in Australian languages. Traditional definitions of demonstratives as primarily making spatial reference have recently evolved at a great pace, with close analyses of demonstratives-in-use revealing that their use in spatial reference, in narrative discourse, and in interaction is significantly more complex than previously assumed, and that definitions of demonstrative forms are best developed after consideration of their use across these contexts. The present study reinforces findings of complexity in demonstrative use, and the significance of a multidimensional characterization of demonstrative forms. This study is therefore a contribution to the description of Dalabon, to the analysis of demonstratives in Australian languages, and to the theory and typology of demonstratives cross-linguistically. In this study, I present a multi-dimensional analysis of Dalabon demonstratives, using a variety of theoretical frameworks and research tools including descriptive linguistics, lexical-functional grammar, discourse analysis, gesture studies and pragmatics. Using data from personal narratives, improvised interactions and elicitation sessions to investigate the demonstratives, this study takes into account their morphosyntactic distribution, uses in the speech situation, interactional factors, discourse phenomena, concurrent gesture, and uses in personal narratives. I conclude with a unified account of the intenstional and extensional semantics of each form surveyed. The Dalabon demonstrative paradigm divides into two types, those which are spatially-specific and those which are non-spatial. The spatially-specific demonstratives nunda ‘this (in the here-space)’ and djakih ‘that (in the there-space)’ are shown not to encode the location of the referent per se, rather its relative position to dynamic physical and social elements of the speech situation such as the speaker’s engagement area and here-space. Both forms are also used as spatial adverbs to mean ‘here’ and ‘there’ respectively, while only nunda is also used as a temporal adverb ‘now, today’. The spatially-specific demonstratives are limited to situational use in narratives. The non-spatial demonstratives kanh/kanunh ‘that (identifiable)’ and nunh ‘that (unfamiliar, contrastive)’ are used in both the speech situation and personal narratives to index referents as ‘identifiable’ or ‘unfamiliar’ respectively. Their use in the speech situation can conversationally implicate that the referent is distal. The non-spatial demonstratives display the greatest diversity of use in narratives, each specializing for certain uses, yet their wide distribution across discourse usage types can be described on account of their intensional semantics. The findings of greatest typological interest in this study are that speakers’ choice of demonstrative in the speech situation is influenced by multiple simultaneous deictic parameters (including gesture); that oppositions in the Dalabon demonstrative paradigm are not equal, nor exclusively semantic; that the form nunh ‘that (unfamiliar, contrastive)’ is used to index a referent as somewhat inaccessible or unexpected; that the ‘recognitional’ form kanh/kanunh is instead described as ‘identifiable’; and that speakers use demonstratives to index emotional deixis to a referent, or to their addressee.},

  abstract = {This article focuses on the question to what degree typological characteristics of the languages involved interact with the Matrix Language vs. Embedded Language and Content Morpheme vs. System Morpheme distinctions. In addition, the integration of Estonian items in Russian-Estonian codeswitched sentences is described, because the extent of integration of Estonian items into the Russian matrix is closely related to matrix language determination. Both Estonian and Russian have a complex inflectional morphology. Full integration of an Estonian item into Russian means gender and case assignment, but in fact this does not occur in all codeswitched instances. Russian-Estonian data demonstrate a wider range of possibilities than just fully integrated and completely unintegrated items. Estonian items may be integrated phonologically into Russian (e.g. regarding vowel length or stress), but morphological and phonological integration do not depend on each other: Estonian items may show extensive phonological but no morphological integration into Russian and vice versa. Bilingual data show that the matrix language cannot be determined by analyzing the morphosyntactic level only; the degree of phonological integration of codeswitched words should also be taken into account. Thus, the morphosyntactic bias in the Matrix Language Frame model, meaning that phonological adaptation has no influence at all on matrix language assignment, is criticized.},

  abstract = {Most patterns of word formation convey more than one meaning. Although multifunctionality is such a widespread phenomenon, only a limited number of topics, such as the polysemy of diminutives, action nouns and agent nouns, have received special attention in the theoretical literature. The present article focuses on instrument and place nouns, which are expressed by means of one and the same derivational pattern in more than half of the languages expressing these two concepts morphologically. The empirical assessment of this syncretism provides the starting point for an in-depth discussion of multifunctionality in word formation. After a review of the literature on monosemy, polysemy and homonymy, diachronic pathways leading to syncretism of instrument and place nouns are described in detail. It turns out that the syncretism is not due to a particular semantic affinity of the concepts 'instrument' and 'place', as sometimes assumed in the literature, including the recent semantic-maps approach. Instead, five different processes can be discerned which lead to the multifunctionality of the respective markers: reanalysis, concretization of action nouns, ellipsis, homonymization, and borrowing.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.pragma.2012.03.009},
  abstract = {Disagreement can be defined as the expression of a view that differs from that expressed by another speaker. Yet, in the relevant literature, disagreement is mostly seen as confrontational and should thus be mitigated or avoided. In CA terms, it is a “dispreferred” second. Similarly, in earlier politeness theories, disagreement is seen to verge on impoliteness. In contrast, recent research has shown that disagreement need not be seen only in negative terms, that is, it may not necessarily result in conflict and impoliteness, but can be a sign of intimacy and sociability and may not destroy but rather strengthen interlocutors’ relationships.

This paper suggests that disagreements are complex, multidirectional and multifunctional acts, which prevent straightforward labelling such as face-threatening/enhancing, (dis)preferred or (im)polite acts. There is inter- and intra-cultural variation depending on various contextual parameters. Significantly, interlocutors have personal traits and relational histories that predispose them to particular strategies and specific evaluations. The claim being disputed in any current interaction may have roots not just in previous turns of the same interaction but also in previous interactions and this should be taken into account when analysing discourse.},

We present the results of ongoing and previous corpus-based analyses of the diachronic development of Dutch want and omdat, and French car and parce que, all four causal connectives roughly meaning ''because''. In addition, we try to show that ''grammaticalization studies can gain from the systematic and principled use of large computerized corpora and the methods which have been developed within corpus linguistics'' (Lindquist and Mair, Corpus approaches to grammaticalization in English, John Benjamins, 2004: x). That's why we have combined two historical and two comparative corpus methods to chart the diachronic development of these four causals. Our study reveals that subjectification is not an integral part of the diachronic development of these causals: subjectification does occur in the rise of these connectives, but in the later stages of their development only parce que undergoes subjectification. Our analyses show that the four methods all have their own merits and limitations, but they are most effective when combined.

  abstract = {This study is based on the theoretical framework of conceptual transfer established by Jarvis (1998, 2007) and on the typology of satellite-framed and verb-framed languages developed by Talmy (1985, 2000). The relationship between conceptual transfer and the thinking for speaking hypothesis (Slobin, 1996b) is also considered. We show that conceptual transfer applies in the translation of lexicalization patterns in motion events from Spanish into English. Our informants are 20 Spanish-speaking translation students who specialize in translation from Spanish/English, English/Spanish. They were faced with a series of 10 sentences containing seven examples including motion verbs and three distractors. The results seem to show that the translations from Spanish to English indicate a preference to follow the L1 lexicalization pattern, coding Path in the main verb and Manner in a separate constituent, as opposed to the English lexicalization pattern where Manner of Motion is conflated in a single lexical item and Path is indicated in a satellite. This misuse of the English pattern can be interpreted as an example of conceptual transfer. When conceptual transfer is at work non-target-like translations are produced. More attention needs to be paid to the different conceptual structures of motion events in both languages.},

  abstract = {Situated within the framework of the conceptual metaphor theory, this article examines universal versus language-specific patterns in metaphorical motion event descriptions, comparing English and Turkish. The analysis focused on the crosslinguistic similarities and differences in the target domains and the types of metaphorical mappings that are structured by spatial motion. The data included written texts in English and Turkish. Results indicated strong crosslinguistic similarity in the target domains and the types of metaphorical mappings. Crosslinguistic variation, on the other hand, became evident in the specification of the source domain structure, particularly in describing the manner component of a metaphorical motion event. English writers paid greater linguistic attention to the way one moves from point A to point B metaphorically, using a greater amount and variety of motion verbs that encoded manner. Overall, the analysis revealed the source domain structure to be the best candidate for systematic language-based variation in a metaphorical event.

Science, 331(6014): 176–82), and using a set of techniques originally developed to measure the complexity of language, we propose a text-based analysis of a large corpus of topic-uncontrolled text to determine how cultural complexity varies over time within a single culture. Using the Google Books American 2Gram corpus, we are able to show that (as predicted from the cumulative nature of culture), US culture has been steadily increasing in complexity, even when (for economic reasons) the amount of actual discourse as measured by publication volume decreases. We discuss several implication of this novel analysis technique as well as its implications for discussion of the meaning of ‘culture.’},

But despite the importance of such large-scale economic phenomena, there has been little research on their discursive construction. This paper presents some empirical data to show how the crisis is identified and its boundaries construed in corporate communication, seeking to understand how economic actors selectively shape public perceptions of critical events by routinely emphasising the role of certain agents and stakeholders while ignoring others. Terms for the crisis, their collocates and their discourse preferences are drawn from a 1,500,000-word ad hoc corpus of annual reports.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the work carried out on the EMILLE Project (Enabling Minority Language Engineering), which was undertaken by the Universities of Lancaster and Sheffield. The primary resource developed by the project is the EMILLE Corpus, which consists of a series of monolingual corpora for fourteen South Asian languages, totalling more than 96 million words, and a parallel corpus of English and five of these languages. The EMILLE Corpus also includes an annotated component, namely, part-of-speech tagged Urdu data, together with twenty written Hindi corpus files annotated to show the nature of demonstrative use in Hindi. In addition, the project has had to address a number of issues related to establishing a language engineering (LE) environment for South Asian language processing, such as translating 8-bit language data into Unicode and producing a number of basic LE tools. The development of tools for EMILLE has contributed to the ongoing development of the LE architecture GATE, which has been extended to make use of Unicode. GATE thus plugs some of the gaps for language processing R\&D necessary for the exploitation of the EMILLE corpora.},

Unfortunately, the standard interface is far too simplistic to allow many types of useful research on this massive dataset. In this paper, I discuss an alternative "advanced" architecture and interface for these datasets, which is freely available at googlebooks.byu.edu. This resource allows for a wide range of research on lexical, phraseological, syntactic, and semantic changes in English, in ways that would not be possible with the standard interface. With this new resource, researchers now have access to hundreds of billions of words of data, and can map out changes in English in ways that were not previously possible.},

  abstract = {Ergativity in the Indo-Aryan languages is a very intricate phenomenon. At the morphological level, we can observe a certain continuum, from disappearance of ergativity to its reinforcement. The first tendency is clearly visible not only in Eastern Hindi and Bihari dialects, but also in Western Rajasthani. The second tendency can be noted in the Pahari dialects. Somewhere in between are the Western Hindi dialects, which have introduced analytical marking for agent and patient. The transitional character of ergativity in Indo-Aryan can be observed in considering the alignment of the three syntactic-semantic Dixonian primitives, namely A, S, and O (Dixon 1979; 1994). It appears that, in fact, all possible alignments are traceable, even that in which A and O receive the same marking and which has been excluded by typologists (Comrie 1978). However, extending the Dixonian three-primitive system by Obi. (Klimov 1983), we can also observe that the same treatment of A and Obi. (perceived as one of the implications of ergativity) is shared by, for example, early Rajasthani, contemporary Pahari and Western Hindi, where it is closely connected with the polyfunctionality of the ergative postposition.},

Quantifying a specific issue obligates the researcher to consider a wide range of data, thereby increasing the reliability of the analysis.  Data from quantitative studies are also critical in the testing of empirical hypotheses, particularly those having to do with human linguistic cognition.  Moreover, quantitative studies are in a better position to reflect people's actual use of language than analyses that do not use quantitative data.},

  abstract = {The aim of this work is the application of techniques developed in the domain of corpus linguistics to a collection of ancient Greek texts, taking into account not only the canonical text established by modern editors, but also the variant readings recorded in the critical apparatus or in the repertories of conjectures. The dissertation is divided in three connected parts: construction, mapping and analysis of the corpus.

The first part is devoted to corpus construction and it is focused on the techniques to improve the OCR accuracy on classical critical editions. This task is challenging because critical editions are multilingual, the set of characters to recognize is wide and the quality of last centuries paper is variable. Three OCR engines are applied to the same texts and a Bayesian classifier, joint to a specific spell-checker, evaluates the most probable output. It is demonstrated that the improvement is significative and, in the best cases, it is more than 3\%.

The second part is devoted to the alignment of the contents extracted from critical apparatus and repertories of conjectures to the reference text. TOGLIERE A parser has been developed to classify the chunks of information (verse number, Greek word sequences, textual operation, scholar that suggested the conjecture). Alignment algorithms used to find the precise position of the conjecture in its context are illustrated in detail.

The third part is devoted to the study of the semantic spaces of ancient Greek. The chapter is focused on the specificity of the corpus, that is morphologically complex, literary (both poetry and prose) and diachronical (from VIII century B.C. to XV century A.D.). The word senses in documents belonging to different genres are explored, and the diachronical change of meaning is observed. 

Finally, a couple of meaningful conjectures extracted in the first part is analysed, evaluating the most interesting reciprocal relations in the semantic space.},

  abstract = {There is do question nowadays as to the international and powerful status of English at a global scale and, consequently, as to its presence in non-English speaking countries at different levels. Linguistically speaking, English is one of the languages which have mostly influenced Spanish throughout its history and especially from the late 1960s. In this study, the impact of English on Spanish is considered in the language of sports; particularly, sports Anglicisms and false Anglicisms are analysed. Due attention is paid to the different forms that an Anglicism may adopt and to which of those forms arc more widely accepted or rejected by prescriptivists and speakers at large, in the light of a contrastive analysis of their appearance in the Nuevo diccionario de anglicismos, the Diccionario de la Real Academia Española and the Corpus de Referencia del Español Actual (English)},

  shorttitle = {Corpus-Based Evidence for the Construal of Adjectives with Multiple Meanings},
  abstract = {Semantically complex linguistic structures have regularly presented a challenge to
traditional accounts of semantics as well as cognitive semantics. In this respect,
adjectival meaning has proved to be a particular challenge, which results from the
mixed properties residing in the category ADJECTIVE itself. Any account of adjectives
is faced with the difficulty of having to accommodate both their lexical and
grammatical meanings. Traditionally, an adjective’s primary function has consisted
in assigning properties to the noun it premodifies. As will be shown, this is an
oversimplification given that adjectives may assign different types of properties,
which, inevitably, will have an impact on their construal. What is more, the findings
of the corpus analysis at hand suggest that adjectival meaning cannot be restricted
to adjective-noun combinations alone. Therefore, this paper sets out to demonstrate
that the construal of adjectives chiefly occurs on the basis of contextual factors
located outside the adjective-noun combination. It will be argued that the
constraining influence of contextual input is particularly vital for the construal of
adjectives with multiple meanings. The adjective new is a showcase for such an
inquiry as its meaning potential reveals a complex meaning representation of two
major clusters, according to which newness is either expressed in terms of temporal
or categorial properties. Using corpus-based methodology, the study provides
compelling evidence of highly recurrent patterns, i.e. colligations in which the
adjective new is typically embedded in nominal constructions including several
prepositional phrases. This important finding underlines that the construal of new
relies on the contextual information available from the different layers of complex
nominals. This layered (conceptual) structure of nominals manifests itself as
contextual patterns including grounding elements or qualifications such as
postmodifying prepositional phrases.},

How is this shift related to "irregular agreement" (such as she for ships) and "sexist" language use (such as generic he) in Modern English, and how is the language continuing to evolve in these respects? Anne Curzan's accessibly written and carefully researched study is based on extensive corpus data, and will make a major contribution by providing a historical perspective on these often controversial questions.

  shorttitle = {Location, Existence, and Possession},
  abstract = {The semantic space location-existence-possession has been investigated from different perspectives since Lyons 1967. In this paper it is first accurately redefined (Section 2) so that it constitutes an operative onomasiological grid for lexical and constructional typological research. Patterns of joint expression of categories and of clear distinction of categories are examined over significant subparts of the relevant semantic space (Sections 2.3/3.1: possession corresponding e.g., to E. The boy had a book; thematic location: E. The book was on the table; rhematic location: E. There was a book on the table; bounded existence: E. There are many lions in Africa; ( generic) existence: E. There are many unhappy people). This research is conducted on the basis of an initial 19-language sample (Section 3.2 and Appendix B), which, despite its bias towards Europe and Africa, yields very interesting observations concerning crosslinguistic tendencies and the effects of genetic affiliation and areal proximity. Since for the typology of this field it is not only the verbal lexical item that counts, but the whole construction (in some languages even with zero copula), adequate tools for a constructional typology have to be developed in terms of inheritance links inspired by Construction Grammar (Section 4). In the central sections of the paper, crosslinguistic patterns of inheritance and of clear distinction of categories within the semantic space are analyzed with respect to the target concepts possession (Section 5), location (Section 6), and existence (Section 7). On the semantic level the relevant links are all metonymic or at least contiguity-based. From the detailed analyses several interesting crosslinguistic, but also areal tendencies can be gathered (Section 8.1). A general hypothesis about the domain location +  existence emerges: languages either opt for informational salience, opposing thematic location to the (rhematic) rest, or for propositional salience, opposing (generic) location to existence, or they dismiss both types of salience, linking (generic) location and existence directly to each other. As a conclusion, three interesting methodological and theoretical issues are addressed: the non-necessary congruence between synchronic patterns and diachronic paths (Section 8.2.1), problems of the conceptual grid in the realm rhematic existence/ rhematic location (Section 8.2.2), and the utility of an account in terms of constructional typology (8.2.3).},

  abstract = {The present paper evaluates the claim that abstract conceptual domains are structured through metaphorical mappings from domains grounded directly in experience. In particular, the paper asks whether the abstract domain of time gets its relational structure from the more concrete domain of space. Relational similarities between space and time are outlined along with several explanations of how these similarities may have arisen. Three experiments designed to distinguish between these explanations are described. The results indicate that (1) the domains of space and time do share conceptual structure, (2) spatial relational information is just as useful for thinking about time as temporal information, and (3) with frequent use, mappings between space and time come to be stored in the domain of time and so thinking about time does not necessarily require access to spatial schemas. These findings provide some of the first empirical evidence for Metaphoric Structuring. It appears that abstract domains such as time are indeed shaped by metaphorical mappings from more concrete and experiential domains such as space.},

  abstract = {Many metaphor researchers, especially within the framework of Cognitive Linguistics, have argued that the conceptual link between sight and intellect is universal. However, there are many studies, mainly anthropological but also linguistic, that contradict not only the universality of these metaphors, but also the predominant role of vision in the domain of cognition. In this paper, I will discuss the role of 'embodiment' and the importance of 'culture' in the creation and conceptualisation of perception metaphors. The main point will be to show that all human beings use the senses for gathering and processing information, but that the sense through which they choose to access that knowledge depends on the culture they are embedded in. First of all, I will describe the senses in terms of 'prototypical properties'. Then, I will show that the properties that apply to one sense in one culture might be applicable to a different sense in another culture. Rather than identifying one specific sense with one specific cognitive capability (UNDERSTANDING IS VISION), it is necessary to formulate these relationships on a more general and abstract level (UNDERSTANDING IS PERCEPTION).

  title = {The Use of Configural Frequency Analysis for Explorative Data Analysis},
  abstract = {Configural frequency analysis (CFA) is a widely used method of explorative data analysis. It tries to detect patterns in the data that occur significantly more or significantly less often than expected by chance. Patterns which occur more often than expected by chance are called CFA types, while those which occur less often than expected by chance are called CFA antitypes. The patterns detected are used to generate knowledge about the mechanisms underlying the data. We investigate the ability of CFA to detect adequate types and antitypes in a number of simulation studies. The basic idea of these studies is to predefine sets of types and antitypes and a mechanism which uses them to create a simulated data set. This simulated data set is then analysed with CFA and the detected types and antitypes are compared to the predefined ones. The predefined types and antitypes together with the method to generate the data are called a data generation model. The results of the simulation studies show that CFA can be used in quite different research contexts to detect structural dependencies in observed data. In addition, we can learn from these simulation studies how much data is necessary to enable CFA to reconstruct the predefined types and antitypes with sufficient accuracy. For one of the data generation models investigated, implicitly underlying knowledge space theory, it was shown that zero-order CFA can be used to reconstruct the predefined types (which can be interpreted in this context as knowledge states) with sufficient accuracy. Theoretical considerations show that first-order CFA cannot be used for this data generation model. Thus, it is wrong to consider first-order CFA, as is done in many publications, as the standard or even only method of CFA.},

  abstract = {Western scholarship on early Chinese thought has tended to either dismiss the foundational role of metaphor or to see it as a uniquely Chinese mode of apprehending the world. This article argues that, while human cognition is in fact profoundly dependent on imagistic conceptual structures, such dependence is by no means a unique feature of Chinese thought. The article reviews empirical evidence supporting the claims that human thought is fundamentally imagistic; that sensorimotor schemas are often used to structure our understanding of abstract concepts; that these schemas can be selectively combined to result in novel structures; and that there are inextricable connections between body, emotion, and thought in both everyday and philosophical cognition. It also provides a review of a recent trend where, explicitly or not, scholars from a variety of backgrounds have begun to take metaphor more seriously as a foundational bearer of philosophical meaning in early China.},

  abstract = {This article explores the constraints that underlie the functioning of motion verbs expressing movement in a particular way (e.g. skulk, scamper). Our study has been carried out in accordance with the postulates of the Lexical Constructional Model (LCM), as put forward by Ruiz de Mendoza and Mairal (2006). The LCM accounts for the relationship between lexical and syntactic meaning by merging into one unified approach relevant theoretical and methodological assumptions from both functional projectionist theories such as Role and Reference Grammar, on the one hand, and constructional models of linguistic description, on the other. Such a combined framework allows us to offer a comprehensive characterization of the verbs under scrutiny, including (1) syntactically relevant information (logical structure), (2) semantic content (lexical template) and (3) those cognitive and pragmatic constraints which may license, restrict or block the fusion of lexical templates into higher-level constructional patterns.

  abstract = {Recent developments in cognitive linguistics have highlighted the importance as well as the ubiquity of metaphor in language. Despite this, the ability of second language learners to use metaphors is often still not seen as a core ability. In this paper, we take a model of communicative competence that has been widely influential in both language teaching and language testing, namely Bachman (1990), and argue, giving a range of examples of language use and learner difficulty, that metaphoric competence has in fact an important role to play in all areas of communicative competence. In other words, it can contribute centrally to grammatical competence, textual competence, illocutionary competence, sociolinguistic competence, and strategic competence. Metaphor is thus highly relevant to second language learning, teaching and testing, from the earliest to the most advanced stages of learning.},

The crosslinguistic diversity of lexical semantics in motion verbs is illustrated in detail for the domain of 'go', 'come', and 'arrive' type contexts. It is argued that the theoretical bases underlying probabilistic semantic maps from exemplar data are the isomorphism hypothesis (given any two meanings and their corresponding forms in any particular language, more similar meanings are more likely to be expressed by the same form in any language), similarity semantics (similarity is more basic than identity), and exemplar semantics (exemplar meaning is more fundamental than abstract concepts).

However, most proposals for assessing productivity have focused on the most productive processes and how to measure them, to the detriment of processes which give rise to fewer items than the ones usually studied in analyses of word-formation productivity. The present paper looks at the major models for productivity measurement and applies them to a BNC-based 5,891-item corpus to test how they account for low productivity. The results obtained highlight significant differences between various productivity counts in an area which, from this point of view, needs further methodological development.},

  shorttitle = {Contractions of {{English}} Semi-Modals},
  abstract = {The current restructuring of the English modal system has long been noted as an ongoing language change process. Semi-modal constructions such as 'BE going to' and 'HAVE got to' are textbook cases of grammaticalization. As grammaticalization comes with a rise in frequency, these semi-modals are also typical examples of the ‘reducing effect’ of frequency, which leads to the contracted forms 'gonna' and 'gotta'. These forms have in recent times become conventional in spoken English. This book presents the first comprehensive corpus-based study of the use and development of the semi-modal contractions 'gonna', 'gotta' and 'wanna'. Focusing on American English, it considers synchronic data from spontaneous spoken language as well as diachronic data from a corpus of speech-purposed writing. The findings are complemented by data from an elicitation experiment, yielding insights into how listeners perceive these forms. Beyond documenting the use of the contractions and full forms in American English, the book provides an investigation into the mental representation of the contractions between phonetic reduction and lexicality. An ‘emancipating effect’ of frequency is proposed by which the contracted forms move from reduction to lexicality, that is, they are increasingly used and perceived as lexical items independent of their source forms. Resulting from these studies, five parameters of lexical emancipation are proposed: - an increase in relative frequency (relative to the source form) - a decline of reduction features - a decline of social restrictions - a semantic/functional divergence (from the source form) - a structural divergence (from the source form) Based on this, lexical emancipation can be described as a change by which the item proceeds through various stages, namely on-line phonetic reduction $>$ on-line morpho-phonological fusion $>$ stored pronunciation variant $>$ stored lexical variant $>$ independent lexical item. Gegenstand dieser Arbeit sind die verkürzten Formen (Kontraktionen) der englischen Modalausdrücke (‘semi-modals’) 'BE going to', 'HAVE got to' und 'want to'. Die Kontraktionen sind in der gesprochenen Sprache häufig und zeigen sich in den Schreibweisen 'gonna', 'gotta' und 'wanna'. Sie werden im Nordamerikanischen Englisch untersucht. Den Hintergrund der Arbeit bildet die Grammatikalisierung der ‘semi-modals’, die mit einem Anstieg der Gebrauchshäufigkeit einhergeht. Diese erhöhte Frequenz fördert phonetische Reduktion (z.B. von “going to” zu “goinde”/“gonna”). Das Auftreten der Kontraktionen ist also zunächst eine Konsequenz aus diesem Frequenzanstieg. Doch das ist nicht das Ende der Entwicklung: Die Reduktionsformen 'gonna', 'gotta' und 'wanna' sind zunehmend häufig und üblich, sodass sie beginnen, sich als eigenständige Wörter zu etablieren und von ihren Ausgangsformen unabhängig zu werden. Dies ist eine Folge der Häufigkeit der Kontraktionen selbst. Es ist also ein Frequenzeffekt, der hier als ‘Emanzipierungseffekt’ (‘emancipating effect’) ausgeführt wird. Als ‘sich emanzipierende’ Elemente stehen die Kontraktionen in Variation mit ihren Ausgangsformen, und diese Variation ist ursprünglich phonologischer, aber mit zunehmender ‘Emanzipation’ mehr und mehr lexikalischer Natur. Untersuchungen dieser Variationen bilden den Hauptteil dieser Arbeit, wobei der Emanzipationsprozess gezeigt wird. Kapitel 3 beinhaltet eine Studie im gesprochenen Nordamerikanischen Englisch (Santa Barbara Corpus of Spoken American English), die eine Reihe von Faktoren berücksichtigt und durch den Vergleich älterer und jüngerer Sprecher die Veränderungen in der Variation misst. Dabei zeigen 'gonna', 'gotta' und 'wanna' einen deutlichen Anstieg in der relativen Frequenz (relativ zur jeweiligen Ausgangsform), wohingegen weniger konventionalisierte Kontraktionen, “tryna” (von 'trying to') und “needa” (von 'need to'), keine so deutliche Entwicklung haben. Die Emanzipation zeigt sich besonders deutlich bei 'gonna': Typische Reduktions-Faktoren wie hohe Sprechgeschwindigkeit und häufige Kollokation (hier mit dem Subjekt: 'I’m going to/gonna') bedingen zwar die phonetische Reduktion zu “goinde” oder “ena”, nicht aber den Gebrauch von 'gonna'. Zudem bestehen soziale Einschränkungen (Bildung, regionale Varietät) nur in der älteren Generation – die Kontraktion wird “gesellschaftsfähig”. Eine Tendenz zu semantischer Divergenz ist bei 'gonna' und 'wanna' erkennbar. In Kapitel 4 werden die Kontraktionen diachron untersucht, in Bühnenstücken und Filmskripten aus dem 20. Jht. (Corpus of Historical American English). Hier zeigt sich ein drastischer, gleichzeitiger Frequenzanstieg aller drei Formen, relativ wie absolut, in den späten 1960er Jahren. Untersuchungen der Variations-Faktoren vor und nach dieser Zäsur ergeben, dass Emanzipation sich in quantitativen Verschiebungen der Effekte zeigen lässt. So kommen 'gonna' und 'wanna' in zunehmend komplexeren Sätzen vor. Die Unterschiede zwischen Kontraktion und Vollform in Bezug auf Register und Kollokation nehmen generell ab. Außerdem sind die Kontraktionen an Phrasengrenzen stark präferiert, was als syntaktische Divergenz angesehen wird. Aus diesen Korpusstudien ergeben sich 5 Indikatoren für die Emanzipation einer verkürzten Form: Anstieg der relativen Frequenz (relativ zur Ausgangsform); Abnahme von Reduktionseigenschaften; Abnahme sozialer Restriktionen; Semantische Divergenz (von der Ausgangsform); Strukturelle Divergenz (von der Ausgangsform). Auf der Grundlage dieser Ergebnisse beschreibt Kapitel 5 ein Experiment zur Wahrnehmung von 'gonna' und 'gotta' im Vergleich zu den Vollformen. Auch hier ist die Akzeptanz von 'gonna' höher, v.a. in der jüngeren Generation. Unterschiede zeigen sich auch bei erhöhter Sprechgeschwindigkeit (als Faktor für phonetische Reduktion, s.o.). Schnell gesprochenes “going to” und “gonna” wird ebenso gut unterschieden wie in Normalgeschwindigkeit, die Zwischenform “goinde” jedoch wird öfter als 'gonna' wahrgenommen. Das zeigt, dass 'gonna' eine weitgehend unabhängige Form ist; bei 'gotta' ist dies nicht so deutlich. Ein anderer ‘Reduktions-Faktor’, die häufige Kollokation, zeigt einen konträren Effekt, so dass aus gehörtem “I’m gonna” und sogar “I’mna” oft 'I’m going to' rekonstruiert wird. Es scheint also, dass Hörer in frequenten Kollokationen eine Reduktion erwarten und (hyper-)korrigieren. Insgesamt ist, anhand der 5 genannten Kriterien, 'gonna' die am stärksten emanzipierte Form. Anhand der beschriebenen Ergebnisse lässt sich die Emanzipation einer verkürzten Form als ein Prozess beschreiben, von spontaner phonetischer Reduktion über morpho-phonologische Fusion zu einer gespeicherten Aussprachevariante, von dieser über eine eingeschränkt verfügbare lexikalische Variante zu einem eigenständigen ‘Wort’. Diese Darstellung des Emanzipationseffekts beschreibt einen allgemeinen Mechanismus im Sprachwandel, der in künftigen Studien überprüft werden kann.},

  abstract = {Bagi yang ingin mencari beasiswa untuk studi lanjut, selain yang ditawarkan rutin (Dikti-BPPS/Indonesia, Stuned/Netherland, DAAD/German, Ausaid-ALA/Australia, Aminef-Fulbright/USA, Chevening/UK dll), sebenarnya proyek2 riset yang ada di perguruan2 tinggi di Eropa/Amerika itu membutuhkan peneliti2 untuk mengerjakannya. Dimana penelitian itu sekaligus menjadi thesis S2/S3. Kita akan menjadi staff peneliti mereka, mengerjakan proyek riset mereka, dan mereka menggaji kita dg tuition fee dan living cost. Saya mencoba mensarikan apa yang telah saya lakukan dan sudah mendapatkannya untuk membiayai S2 dan S3 saya. Target pembacanya ketika dibuat sebenarnya untuk anggota milis beasiswa (suatu milis berbagi informasi untuk para pencari beasiswa).Semoga bermanfaat.},

It teaches them to identify and develop arguments, to read and form reactions and opinions of their own, to analyze an audience, to seek common ground, and to use a wide, realistic range of techniques to write argument papers that express their individual views and original perspectives on modern issues. It includes clear explanations and examples of argument theory and reading and writing processes, research and documentation skills, and offers engaging, class-tested writing assignments and activities. 49 Essays for Analysis cover several broad issue and sub-issue areas, all of contemporary concern. Unique chapters discuss student argument styles, Rogerian argument, and argument and literature.},

  abstract = {This paper reports findings from a study of the frequency and distribution of a set of modals and quasi-modals in nine matching corpora representing British, American, Australian, New Zealand, Philippines, Singapore, Hong Kong, Indian and Kenyan English. The analysis presented is form-based, with meanings dealt with only in an exemplary, qualitative manner. The findings are discussed in the light of two complementary trends noted by corpus linguists: a rise in the popularity of the quasi-modals, and a decline in that of the modals. The study notes a strong tendency for American English to be leading the way in these developments within the four ‘Inner Circle’ varieties, and for the South-East Asian varieties as a set to be leading the way within the ‘Outer Circle’ varieties. The evidence furthermore indicates that stylistic variation is a contributing factor in the trends observed, with quasi-modals flourishing in speech and their modal counterparts more at home in written registers.},

Strucplot displays include hierarchical conditional plots such as mosaic, association, and sieve plots, and can be combined into more complex, specialized plots for visualizing conditional independence, GLMs, and the results of independence tests. The framework's modular design allows flexible customization of the plots' graphical appearance, including shading, labeling, spacing, and legend, by means of "graphical appearance control" functions. The framework is provided by the R package vcd.},

  abstract = {The present study adds to our understanding of how learners employ lexical and grammatical phenomena to communicate in writing in different types of interlanguage discourse. A multidimensional (factor) analysis of a corpus of L2 Spanish writing (202,241 words) generated by second- and third-year, university-level learners was performed. The analysis uncovered four significant clusters that can be considered distinct discourse types with two main stylistic variations: narrative (characterized by verbal features) and expository (characterized by nominal features). Results also provide examples of the multiple ways that stylistic sophistication and linguistic complexity occur in the L2. Although the Spanish learners’ discourse did not show signs of syntactic complexity (e.g. frequent use of relative clauses, subordinate clauses, use of clitics), the frequent use of nominal features affects informational density due to the presence of numerous derivational morphemes. Inflectional complexity in the form of marked forms was not predominant in the data set. Still, the learners’ verbal inflections did vary, which is a sign of L2 development (Howard 2002, 2006; Collentine 2004; Marsden and David 2008).},

  abstract = {This paper presents an overview of a project that aims at creating a representative catalogue of crosslinguistically recurring semantic shifts in the languages of the world and at implementing this catalogue in the form of a searchable computer database. Such a catalogue is useful in several theoretical and methodological respects. First of all, both universal and language-specific semantic shifts can be considered a window onto human cognitive mechanisms operative in the domain of linguistic conceptualization. Second, the catalogue provides a rich empirical basis for the study of genetic and areal tendencies in semantic change, as well as in polysemy patterns. Another potential application is historical reconstruction, since the catalogue gives evidence for attested paths of diachronic semantic evolution. In Section 1 we outline the general concept of the catalogue of semantic shifts. Section 2 describes the design of the computer database. In Section 3 we discuss some difficulties that we have faced while working on the catalogue. The next three sections demonstrate how the catalogue can be used in linguistic research and present an analysis of three selected issues, namely semantic shifts in the domain of dimension (Section 4), motivation strategies in the domain of folk biology (Section 5), and euphemization as a mechanism of semantic change (Section 6).},

  abstract = {Conceptual metaphor analysis in political discourse has been the focus of many cognitive linguists (Lassan 1995; Lakoff 1996; Musolff 2004; Charteris-Black 2005; Goatly 2007; Semino 2008, etc.). Moreover, the recent years of political discourse analysis have undergone cross-fertilization between cognitive researches into metaphor and critical discourse analysis. Thus, this paper aims at analyzing the right-wing and left-wing ideologies of Lithuanian political parties through cognitive metaphor perspective since metaphor is regarded to be a cognitive mechanism of ideology. It is generally assumed that political parties verbally and non-verbally behave in accordance with the ideology they adopt. Therefore, the research employing conceptual metaphor analysis blended with rhetorical persuasion approach attempts to look into the subtleties of the relationship between the conventional conservative or social democratic ideology of a party and its linguistic performance. The question whether Lithuanian political parties really adopt the ideology their party name implies is brought up. Empirically, the research is based on election discourse of Lithuanian Conservative and Social Democratic parties. First, metaphorically used words and phrases in the target discourse were identified applying the Pragglejaz Metaphor Identification Procedure ("MIP") (2007). Next, it is taken into consideration that the identified metaphorically used words tend to construct a certain scenario which underlies a certain conceptual metaphor. Once this relation is established, ideological implications of the metaphorical expressions and their underlying conceptual metaphors are highlighted and analysed. Also, the research takes into account rhetorical effect produced by ideological implications of the analyzed parties. (English)},

Adapting the prototype-plus-distortion methodology of Franks and Bransford (1971), we found that whereas adults were lured toward false-positive recognition of sentences with prototypical transitive semantics, young children showed no such effect. We examined two main implications of the results. First, it adds a novel data point to a growing body of research in cognitive linguistics and construction grammar that shows abstract linguistic categories can behave in similar ways to non-linguistic categories, for example, by showing graded membership of a category. Thus, the findings lend psychological validity to the existing cross-linguistic evidence for prototypical transitive semantics. Second, we discuss a possible explanation for the fact that prototypical sentences were processed differently in adults and children, namely, that children's transitive semantic network is not as interconnected or cognitively coherent as adults'.},

Although several American and European organizations show regularly in their public websites the aggregated results of organ donation and transplantation, no tools are provided to engage with the final users and to enable them to handle these data. In this study, a new model of Web-based interactive motion charts was applied to aggregated liver transplantation data obtained from a consecutive 28-year series of liver transplantation performed in a single Italian center. The interactive charts were obtained by combining the Google visualization application programming interface and the googleVis package within the open source statistical environment R. The interactive charts may be embedded into online/offline Web pages and rendered in each common browser. The users may interact with the charts by selecting chart type (bubble, bar, or line chart), x- and y-axis scales (linear or logarithmic), variables, bubble size, color, and even changing opacity of unselected items. Moreover, the charts may dynamically display the trend over time of each continuous/categoric variable, allowing users both to trace how the lines changes over time and to control the animation speed. The interactive motion charts should be used in the public websites that manage aggregated data concerning organ donation and transplantation.},

  abstract = {Cognitive linguists have recently made great efforts to integrate their research interests with Labovian sociolinguistics. One of the promising areas of investigation in cognitive sociolinguistics is metaphor variation. In this study, we aimed to compare metaphor differences in email invitations from Chinese speakers of English and native speakers of English. Twenty-nine college students in Taiwan were recruited to write English email invitations in four hypothetical situations, so a total of 114 invitation emails were collected, which constituted the Chinese English corpus. These students were also asked to download 56 email invitations from the Internet to constitute the non-Chinese English corpus. Our preliminary observations led us to identify two metaphors for the respective corpora: "Giving invitation is borrowing money" for the Chinese English corpus, while "Giving invitation is delivering messages" for the non -Chinese English corpus. To test our hypothesis, we compared these two sets of data in terms of information sequencing and verb usage. For information sequencing, Chinese speakers of English tend to locate their invitation sentences in the later part of an email because they consider invitation as a face-threatening act, which requires small talk before they actually state their purposes. As for verb usage, Chinese speakers of English preferred to use WANT, NEED, and HOPE in their invitation sentences since these three verbs express their personal needs. A VARBRUL analysis was conducted to identify three factor groups that could best account for the use of these three verbs: i.e., email sender's role, gender and perceived distance between the sender and the recipient.},

  abstract = {Today's corpus tools offer the user a wide range of features that greatly facilitate the linguistic analysis of large amounts of authentic language data (e.g. frequency distributions, collocations, keywords, etc.). However, these tools typically fail to address the fundamental need of the linguist to add interpretive information to a concordance or query result, by coding individual concordance lines for structural, functional, discoursal, and other features in a flexible way. The ability to add such qualitative data is indispensable to a fuller understanding of the phenomenon under investigation as it allows the linguist to produce more rigorous descriptions—and theories—about language in use. Our article has two aims: first, to assess the merits and drawbacks of existing solutions, by surveying what can be achieved using state-of-the-art corpus tools and generic database software; second, we draw up a set of desiderata and recommendations for the incorporation of flexible encoding features into future corpus tools. We describe an initial step in this direction, with a recent enhancement to the BNCweb corpus analysis software. More generally, we hope our suggestions will lead to linguists and software developers working together more closely to ensure that the needs of the former are provided for by the available technology.},

  doi = {10.1515/LING.2007.002},
  shorttitle = {On the Middle Voice},
  abstract = {In this article we approach the phenomenon of the English middle voice from a functional-cognitive perspective. Assuming the distinction between representational and interpersonal layers of organization in the clause (Halliday 1985; Hengeveld 1989; McGregor 1997), we propose that the elements and relations that define the English middle are of an interpersonal nature. We argue that the characteristic relation between nonagentive subject and active VP in the middle cannot be generalized in terms of a specific process-participant relation, as has been attempted in the literature. It cannot be maintained that the subject entity is always affected by the action, nor that it brings about the action, which would obscure the difference between middle and ergative intransitive. Rather, we propose that the middle subject and finite are related to each other by what Talmy (2000) defines as a “letting” modal relation, which we characterize further as combining active and passive elements. Middles construe a subjective assessment of the subject entity, presenting it as lending itself to the action designated by the predicator, and as having properties that are actively conducive to that action. We also argue that this letting relation between subject and finite can be interpreted as the subjectification of the agentive-patientive relation between the lexical verb and the sole participant in an ergative intransitive clause. The shift towards subject and finite expressing a conduciveness judgment activates an inherent agent in the conceptual base of the predicate. This means that ergative verbs are always used transitively in middles and it explains why other transitive verbs can also occur in middles. In a language like French, which marks both ergative intransitive and middle reflexively, no further extension of middle predicates is possible. By contrast, both Dutch and, more marginally, English, which do not mark middles reflexively, also allow some intransitive and compound transitive predicates to be used in the middle voice.},

Metaphor is one of the major types of figurative language reflecting this, as Jose Ortega y Gasset, a famous Spanish philosopher, proposed in 1948 'The metaphor is probably the most fertile power possessed by man.' Based on an awareness that learning a new language would be more effective if the learner also knew the culture of the target language, the study examined: 1) the abilities to interpret English metaphors of Thai students from different major subjects at the undergraduate and post-graduate levels; 2) their perspectives on the use of English metaphors in news articles; and 3) factors that possibly affected their understanding and interpretation of English metaphors. The data were collected from three undergraduate and postgraduate classes through tests and group interviews. The major findings showed that the students rarely knew the meaning of the metaphors without the contexts given. Many felt metaphors differed in their degree of difficulty. Some felt not knowing metaphoric meanings was a problem in learning English. Overall, the research helped raise an awareness of the importance of culture in language, and had implications for integrating figures of speech in language classes.},

We argue that an explanation of the most deviant derivations with these affixes arises only when we consider the paradigmatic nature of affixal semantics.},

English tends, of course, to use a simple copula in utterances like The cup is on the table, but many languages, perhaps as many as half of the world's languages, have a set of alternate verbs, or alternate verbal affixes, which contrast in this slot. Often these are classificatory verbs of sitting, standing and lying. For this reason, perhaps, Aristotle listed position among his basic (noncomposite) categories.

  shorttitle = {Inferring Universals from Grammatical Variation},
  abstract = {A fundamental fact about grammatical structure is that it is highly variable both across languages and within languages. Typological analysis has drawn language universals from grammatical variation, in particular by using the semantic map model. But the semantic map model, while theoretically well-motivated in typology, is not mathematically well-defined or computationally tractable, making it impossible to use with large and highly variable crosslinguistic datasets. Multidimensional scaling (MDS), in particular the Optimal Classification nonparametric unfolding algorithm, offers a powerful, formalized tool that allows linguists to infer language universals from highly complex and large-scale datasets. We compare our approach to Haspelmath's semantic map analysis of indefinite pronouns, and reanalyze Dahl's (1985) large tense-aspect dataset. MDS works best with large datasets, demonstrating the centrality of grammatical variation in inferring language universals and the importance of examining as wide a range of grammatical behavior as possible both within and across languages.},

  doi = {10.1515/ling-2012-0015},
  abstract = {The semantic domain of pain seems to be unique in that, crosslinguistically, it includes few predicates that are specifically dedicated to pain (like hurt or ache); instead, the major part of the field is constituted by lexical units drawn from other semantic domains, which are applied to pain through processes of semantic derivation (like my eyes are burning, my throat is scratching). After discussing methodological considerations concerning data collection, the article first analyzes the semantic sources for pain predicates and addresses the issue of their typological consistency, based on data from over 20 languages. It is then demonstrated that the evolution of a pain meaning cannot be reduced to a merely semantic process, since the meaning shift may be accompanied by changes in the morphological, morphosyntactic and/or syntactic properties of the source verb. We suggest the term 're-branding' for the complex meaning changes of this kind and discuss their theoretical relation to the well-established notions of metaphor and metonymy.},

  abstract = {This article examines how Korean verbal nouns are construed as either a noun or a verb in a given context. By adopting Langacker's Cognitive Grammar (CG) and its technical apparatus, I argue that the two types of case patterns arise due to different construals of the same content. More specifically, when a verbal noun is construed as a thing (noun), it needs to be nominally grounded to be a full nominal. The genitive-case pattern in verbal noun constructions is motivated by the need for this grounding. By contrast, when the same verbal noun is construed as a process (verb), it needs to be clausally grounded by tense to be a full clause. For the purpose of grounding, the schematic verb ha(y)- 'do' must combine with verbal nouns to lend its processual characteristic to them, since verbal nouns profile a nonprocessual complex relationship. The verbal case pattern arises due to this processual nature of the temporalized verbal nouns. I further argue that a verbal noun in a double accusative construction is indirectly grounded by an implicitly invoked reference point, which is realized as an accusative-marked nominal.},

Leading scholars from around the world introduce and discuss the core theoretical and methodological bases of grammaticalization, report on work in the field, and point to promising directions for new research. They represent every relevant theoretical perspective and approach.Research on grammaticalization and its role in linguistic change encompasses work on languages from every major linguistic family. Its results offer valuable insights for all theoretical frameworks, including generative, construction, and cognitive grammar, and relates to work in fields such as phonology, sociolinguistics, and language acquisition. The handbook provides a full, critical assessment of every aspect of this research. It is divided into five parts, of which the first two are devoted to theory and method, the third and fourth to work in linguistic domains, classes, and cateogories, and the fifth to case studies of grammaticalization in a range of languages. It will be an indispensable source of information and inspiration for all those who wish to know more about this fascinating and important field.},

Several metaphor researchers have criticized the methodology with which metaphor is studied (emphasizing concepts instead of words), the direction of analysis (emphasizing a top-down instead of a bottom-up approach), the category level of metaphor (claiming its superordinate status instead of basic level), the embodiment of metaphor (emphasizing the universal, mechanical, and monolithic aspects instead of nonuniversal, nonmechanical, and nonmonolithic aspects of embodiment), and its relationship to culture (emphasizing the role of universal bodily experience instead of the interaction of body and context). In the paper, I respond to this criticism largely based on my own research and propose a view on these issues that can successfully meet these challenges and that can be regarded as an alternative to the “standard theory.”},

This method, based on the paradigm of distributional semantics, quantifies semantic similarity on the basis of contextual similarity in two comparable corpora. In two case studies for Dutch and German, we show that it automatically identifies the correct synonym for 31\% and 25\% of the target words, respectively. A manual error analysis moreover indicates that many additional synonyms are very close in the distributional model, while most other distributional neighbours are semantically related to the target word along other dimensions than synonymy. On the basis of these results, we argue that distributional-semantic methods can play a crucial role in the further evolution of corpus-based lexical semantics to a more quantitative discipline.},

  abstract = {Based on a prototype approach to emotion concepts, two studies were conducted: (1) to identify the mental state words that Indonesian speakers are most certain name emotions (perasaan hati) and (2) to map the hierarchical and family-resemblance structure of the top 124 emotion concepts. As in an earlier study of emotion terms in American English (Shaver, Schwartz, Kirson, \& O'Connor, 1987), cluster analysis of sorting data collected in Indonesia revealed five basic-level emotion categories: cinta (love), senang (happiness), marah (anger), kawatir/takut (anxiety/fear), and sedih (sadness). Also in line with the American results, the five basic-level categories formed two large categories at the superordinate level: positive emotions and negative emotions. Each of the five basic-level categories contained several subordinate-level categories, totaling 31 in all. The results suggest that the emotion lexicons, and corresponding conceptualizations of the emotion domain, in Indonesia and the U.S.A. are similar at the superordinate and basic levels but somewhat variable at the subordinate level. This outcome – like other kinds of psychological research on emotions and emotion concepts – suggests that the gross structure of representations of the emotion domain are similar worldwide, perhaps for biological reasons, but that different cultures make different fine-grained distinctions and emphasize different subordinate-level emotion concepts.},

  abstract = {AbstractThis paper introduces an innovative method to aid the study of conceptual onomasiological research, with a specific emphasis on diachronic variation in the metonymic patterns with which a target concept is expressed. We illustrate how the method is applied to explore and visualize such diachronic changes by means of a case study on the metonymic patterns for woman in the history of Chinese. Visualization is done with the help of a Multidimensional Scaling solution based on the profile-based distance calculation (Geeraerts et al. 1999; Speelman et al. 2003) and by drawing diachronic trajectories in a set of MDS maps, corresponding to different metonymic targets. This method proves to be effective and feasible in detecting changes in the distribution of metonymic patterns in authentic historical corpus data. On the basis of this method, we can show that different targets exhibit different degrees of diachronic variation in their metonymic patterns. We find diachronically more stable targets (e.g. imperial woman), targets with a dominant trend in diachronic variation (e.g. a woman), and targets with highly fluctuating historical variation (e.g. beautiful woman). Importantly, we can identify the cultural and social changes that may lie behind some of these changes. Examining the results uncovered by the method offers us a better understanding of the dynamicity of metonymic conceptualizations.},

  abstract = {AbstractThis paper addresses the recent history of noun-participle compounding in English. This word formation process is illustrated by forms such as hand-carved or computer-based. Data from the COHA shows that over the last two-hundred years, such forms have undergone a substantial increase in type and token frequency. These quantitative changes motivate an exploration of the qualitative changes that have accompanied them. A diachronic analysis of the noun and participle types that are recruited into noun-participle compounds reveals that the word formation process has changed substantially with regard to its component parts. While the observable changes in noun-participle compounding match several defining criteria of grammaticalization, it is argued here that these developments are more usefully seen as a process of constructional change. To distinguish between those two, this paper develops an idea that is called the upward strengthening hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, grammaticalization happens when the activation of a node in a constructional network strengthens not only that node itself, but also a node that is situated at a higher, more abstract level of that network.},

This paper investigates the universality\textasciitilde{}relativity of perceptual language by examining the use of basic perception terms in spontaneous conversation across 13 diverse languages and cultures. We analyze the frequency of perception words to test two universalist hypotheses: that sight is always a dominant sense, and that the relative ranking of the senses will be the same across different cultures. We find that references to sight outstrip references to the other senses, suggesting a pan-human preoccupation with visual phenomena. However, the relative frequency of the other senses was found to vary cross-linguistically. Cultural relativity was conspicuous as exemplified by the high ranking of smell in Semai, an Aslian language. Together these results suggest a place for both universal constraints and cultural shaping of the language of perception.},

A more detailed account of the goals and methodology is presented in chapters 2 and 3, respectively. What the Book Is About The main objective of this study is to attempt to answer the question: How do people understand their emotions? As we shall see in the next chapter, a large number of scholars have tried to provide answers to this question. The interest in the way people understand their emotions has led scholars to the issue of the nature of emotion concepts and emotional meaning. Since the notion of understanding involves or presupposes the notions of concept and meaning, it was only natural for scholars with an interest in the way people understand their emotions to tum their attention to emo­ tion concepts and the meaning associated with emotion terms. So the broader issue has often become more specific. For example, Davitz in his The Language of Emotion formulated the central question in the following way: "What does a person mean when he says someone is happy or angry or sad?" (Davitz 1969: 1).},

Many programs, both commercial and free, perform CA but none of them as yet provides a visual aid to the interpretation of the results. The ‘CAinterprTools’ package, designed to be used in the free R statistical environment, aims at filling that gap. A novel-to-medium R user has been considered as target. 15 commands enable to easily obtain charts that help (and are relevant to) the interpretation of the CA’s results, freeing the user from the need to inspect and scrutinize tabular CA outputs, and to look up values and statistics on which further calculations are necessary. The package also implements tests to assess the significance of the input table’s total inertia and individual dimensions.},

The results indicate large differences in metaphorical strength.

In this article we first introduce the project on which it is based by motivating the selection of this conceptual domain, presenting the methods of data collection used by all the investigators, and characterizing the language sample. We then present a new approach to examining crosslinguistic similarities and differences in semantic categorization. Applying statistical modeling to the descriptions of cutting and breaking events elicited from speakers of all the languages, we show that although there is crosslinguistic variation in the number of distinctions made and in the placement of category boundaries, these differences take place within a strongly constrained semantic space: across languages, there is a surprising degree of consensus on the partitioning of events in this domain. In closing, we compare our statistical approach with more conventional semantic analyses, and show how an extensional semantic typological approach like the one illustrated here can help illuminate the intensional distinctions made by languages.},

In Sranan, a verb that superficially looks like ‘cut’ in English is actually a break verb. Also, not only break verbs participate in the causative/inchoative alternation, as expected, but cut verbs do also. I argue that the intransitive use of cut verbs does not yield a passive construction as proposed by some; instead, it is inchoative.},

  abstract = {AbstractMandarin categorizes cutting and breaking events on the basis of fine semantic distinctions in the causal action and the caused result. I demonstrate the semantics of Mandarin C\&B verbs from the perspective of event encoding and categorization as well as argument structure alternations. Three semantically different types of predicates can be identified: verbs denoting the C\&B action subevent, verbs encoding the C\&B result subevent, and resultative verb compounds (RVC) that encode both the action and the result subevents. The first verb of an RVC is basically dyadic, whereas the second is monadic. RVCs as a whole are also basically dyadic, and do not undergo detransitivization.},

  abstract = {AbstractWhile there are infinite conceivable events of material separation, those actually encoded in the conventions of a given language's verb semantics number only a few. Furthermore, there appear to be crosslinguistic parallels in the native verbal analysis of this conceptual domain. What are the operative distinctions, and why these? This article analyses a key subset of the bivalent (transitive) verbs of cutting and breaking in Lao. I present a decompositional analysis of the verbs glossed ‘cut (off)’, ‘cut.into.with.placed.blade’, ‘cut.into.with.moving.blade’, and ‘snap’, pursuing the idea that the attested combinations of sub-events have a natural logic to them. Consideration of the nature of linguistic categories, as distinct from categories in general, suggests that the attested distinctions must have ethnographic and social interactional significance, raising new lines of research for cognitive semantics.},

In their morphosyntactic behavior the verbs turned out to be unusual because morphological causatives were found with unaccusative as well as with transitive and labile verbs. Furthermore, the labile verbs were shown to express both cutting and breaking semantics.},

This notional set of verbs is not a class in any grammatical sense; C\&B verbs are formally undistinguishable from many other transitive state-change verbs. But they nicely reveal the characteristic specificity of Tzeltal verb semantics: C\&B actions are finely differentiated according to the spatial and textural properties of the theme object, with no superordinate term meaning ‘either cut in general’ or ‘break in general’. The paper characterizes the semantics of these verbs and shows that in the great majority of cases it does not predict their argument structure.},

  abstract = {AbstractThe studies reported in this special issue exemplify two approaches to semantic typology and to the study of word meaning more generally. One is an extensional approach, which relates verbs of cutting and breaking to the scenes which they are used to describe. The other focuses on the argument structure of the verbs, the relevant data being the verbs' participation in argument structure alternations. It is encouraging that these very different approaches partition the verbs of material separation in roughly compatible ways. This roundup to the special issue also addresses the interpretation of the naming data, with respect to the notions of prototype and basic level. Attention is drawn to the fact that in general the cut and break verbs seem not to display much taxonomic depth, a finding which is in stark contrast to the often elaborate taxonomies exhibited by nominal concepts.},

  abstract = {AbstractMost research on metaphors that construe time as motion (motion metaphors of time) has focused on the question of whether it is the times or the person experiencing them (ego) that moves. This paper focuses on the equally important distinction between metaphors that locate times relative to ego (the ego-based metaphors Moving Ego and Moving Time) and a metaphor that locates times relative to other times (sequence is relative position on a path). Rather than a single abstract target domain TIME, these two kinds of temporal metaphor metaphorize different kinds of temporal concept—perspective-specific vs. perspective-neutral temporal concepts. Recognition of this distinction enhances the explanatory potential of conceptual metaphor theory (Lakoff and Johnson 1980). An example involves the interaction of deixis and the temporal reference crosslinguistically of vocabulary with the spatial meanings in-front and behind. More generally, this approach refines our ability to describe the temporal concepts involved in motion metaphors of time. Such temporal concepts are present not only in the target domains, but also in the source domains of motion metaphors of time, where we find space-to-time metonymy, which may play a role in motivating the metaphors. In order to distinguish such metonymy from metaphor, we need to characterize metaphor as a mapping across frames rather than domains.},

A narrative approach captures both the particularity and the temporal dimension of emotion with greater fidelity than semantic, synchronic, and discourse-based approaches.},

Using the Corpus of Contemporary American English and the Corpus de Referencia del Español, we have analyzed all the occurrences of English jealousy and Spanish celo(s) (and their derivates) in order to make a list of metaphorical source domains for this emotion. The domains identified here have been classified into groups, after which we have compared, both quantitatively and qualitatively, the metaphorical expressions for jealousy in the two languages. Special attention has been paid to the role of sensorial perception in the metaphors articulating the ways speakers from the two cultures feel this emotion. According to our analysis, in spite of the basic role of touch in both languages, American English speakers make use of a wide variety of sensory-related metaphors (including vision, hearing, smelling, and tasting), which, much more frequently than in Spanish, foreground the physical component of this emotion.},

In particular, a corpus-driven quantitative methodology is developed that can provide evidence for modelling the relevant constructional networks. The method is based on hierarchical cluster analysis applied to multivariable data, and several statistical criteria of cluster stability. These points are demonstrated by means of a corpus study of the Netherlandic and Belgian variants of the Dutch causative construction with doen 'do'. The paper describes the national differences in the structure of the constructicon and interprets them from a usage-based historical perspective.},

  abstract = {The present paper investigates the question whether different languages can be categorized into 'constructionally tolerant' languages, which grant speakers considerable freedom to combine syntactic constructions with lexical items in non-conventional ways, and 'valency-driven' languages, which impose stronger restrictions on the way in which constructions and lexical items can be combined. The idea of such a typological distinction is sketched for instance by Rostila (2014). In order to explore possible effects of constructional tolerance, a grammaticality judgment task is administered to speakers of English and French, which are two languages that differ with regard to this phenomenon: English verbs can be used across different argument structure constructions with relative ease, French verbs are more constrained. Both populations of speakers are exposed to stimuli sentences of varying creativity in a second language, namely German. The paper advances the constructional tolerance hypothesis, which states that speakers of a constructionally tolerant language should judge nonconventional examples in an L2 with more lenience than speakers of a valencydriven language. The experimental results are in line with this hypothesis, but they also suggest that grammaticality judgments are influenced by the availability of a productive L1 construction that shows functional overlap.},

The paper illustrates this theoretical approach with a corpus-based study of near-synonymous causative constructions with doen and laten in the Belgian and Netherlandic varieties of Dutch. A series of quantitative analyses show a complex interplay of the dimensions at different levels of constructional schematicity. At the more schematic level, the results indicate that the effects of transitivity and coreferentiality on the probability of the two constructions are slightly different in the two varieties. However, incorporating the effected predicate slot fillers in a mixed-effect model reveals that these differences can be explained to a large extent by the country-specific lexical patterns. These findings suggest that the interplay of the lectal and conceptual factors in constructional variation should be studied at varying degrees of constructional schematicity.},

Findings are considered from diverse subfields across the language sciences, including cognitive linguistics, psycholinguistics, linguistic anthropology, and conversation analysis. Taken together, it is clear that emotional expression is finely tuned to language-specific structures. Future emotion research can better exploit cross-linguistic variation to unravel possible universal principles operating between language and emotion.},

Our aim here is more modest. We propose a list of elements for a working definition of emotion and discuss the justification for the inclusion of elements from our respective perspectives (philosophy and psychology). This working partial definition may at least serve as a litmus test to examine theories of emotion, old and new, across disciplinary boundaries.},

We argue that individual and group differences in facial expression interpretation are too great for a fully specified system of categories to be universal and hardwired. Variations in expression categorization, across individuals and groups, favor a model in which an initial “core” system recognizes only the grouping of positive versus negative emotional expressions. The subsequent development of a rich representational structure may require the integration of a verbal categorization system with a perceptual processing system that is category-agnostic. Such a model may reconcile many strands of apparently conflicting behavioral, physiological, and neuroscience evidence concerning our understanding of facial expressions of emotion.},

These findings show that, consistent with the conceptual metaphor account, the associations between affect and physical domains such as spatial position, musical pitch, brightness, and size which are captured in linguistic metaphors also influence performance on attention, memory and judgment tasks. Despite this evidence, a number of concerns with metaphor as an account of affect representation are considered.},

Finally, two notions of psychological basic-ness are distinguished, and the evidence for them is evaluated.

Despite decades of neuroimaging efforts addressing this question, it remains unclear whether emotions are represented as distinct entities, as predicted by categorical theories, or are constructed from a smaller set of underlying factors, as predicted by dimensional accounts. Here, we capitalize on multivariate statistical approaches and computational modeling to directly evaluate these theoretical perspectives. We elicited discrete emotional states using music and films during functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning. Distinct patterns of neural activation predicted the emotion category of stimuli and tracked subjective experience. Bayesian model comparison revealed that combining dimensional and categorical models of emotion best characterized the information content of activation patterns. Surprisingly, categorical and dimensional aspects of emotion experience captured unique and opposing sources of neural information. These results indicate that diverse emotional states are poorly differentiated by simple models of valence and arousal, and that activity within separable neural systems can be mapped to unique emotion categories.},

The available evidence for surprise and disgust suggests that these emotions are accompanied by their “traditional” facial expressions, and even components of these expressions, only in a minority of cases. Evidence concerning sadness, anger, and fear is very limited. For sadness, one study suggests that high emotion–expression coherence may exist in specific situations, whereas for anger and fear, the evidence points to low coherence.

It begins by contextualising the WebCorpLSE project in relation to its parent project, WebCorp, and other 'web as corpus' initiatives. It then outlines the advantages of WebCorpLSE over Google search, before turning to a comparison of WebCorpLSE with COCA. Comparisons are made by matching extracts of textual and graphical output generated by each system. It is shown that WebCorpLSE provides information not available via the other search mechanisms, and that it can thus, in accordance with Mair's (2007) argument for a combined approach to diachronic text study, usefully serve not only as a stand-alone tool, but as a complementary resource.},

It presents a corpus-based analysis of four Spanish verbs (tirar, lanzar, arrojar and echar) whose primary meaning is ‘to throw.’ A four-hundred sentence sample extracted from the Corpus del Español 1900s subcorpus serves as the basis for this study. Statistical tests are used to compare the verbs’ behavior across several factors: morphological markings such as mood, tense and person, the types of subjects (human versus nonhuman), the types of objects (concrete versus nonconcrete), and the interaction of subject and object in full constructions. The tests are accompanied by semantic analysis of the sample sentences. The result of the statistical and descriptive analyses is a radial categorization that highlights the types of metaphoric and metonymic extensions that each verb uses, and where and how the verbs overlap semantically.},

I first argue for an interdisciplinary approach to the relationship between body, emotion and language, which allows for a holistic perspective to the meaning of these expressions and makes explicit the analogical experiential elements of the particular emotions. As a case study, I look at instances of metaphor within metonymy, which appear to require an interdisciplinary analysis. Drawing on corpus examples, I examine metonymies of joy and happiness with special emphasis on the neurobiological evidence (i.e. the expressive and physiological component of the emotion); the results of the analysis account for how happiness and joy are experienced by the subject.},

  doi = {10.1177/0963947014543608},
  abstract = {Metaphoric language can be examined either from the standpoint of conceptual structure or from the perspective of linguistic form. The role of conceptual metaphor in metaphoric language has received considerable attention, notably in Conceptual Metaphor Theory and Blending Theory, but the impact of linguistic form remains less well understood. Brooke-Rose’s A Grammar of Metaphor (1958) presents subjective impressions of various forms, and more recently, cognitive linguists have examined the metaphoric uses of individual grammatical constructions. However, Stockwell offers the most methodical and comprehensive comparison of metaphorically used constructions along a specified parameter, that of ‘visibility’ (1992, 2000, 2002). On the cline of visibility, constructions range from the most visible constructions, such as simile, to the least visible, such as allegory.
The current article draws on Sullivan’s (2013) study of the role of grammatical constructions in metaphoric language to examine and refine Stockwell’s cline of visibility, inputting the syntactic characteristics of Stockwell’s metaphoric constructions into a multidimensional scaling analysis. The results support Stockwell’s dimension of ‘visibility’, but suggest that the distinctions between metaphorically used constructions are better accounted for in a two-dimensional analysis that considers the dimension of ‘economy’ – the linguistic complexity required to express a conceptual metaphor – alongside ‘visibility’.},

  abstract = {This paper aims to show that metaphors are a powerful tool to frame economic issues and serve certain political interests. To this purpose, we have carried out a comparative study of the conceptual metaphors of the Global Systemic Crisis in both English and Spanish. The financial crisis has indeed caused havoc in the economic panorama worldwide. Spain has been no exception, but, unlike other European countries, financial problems were initially belittled by the Spanish mass media for several months, until the subsequent outbreak of the crisis in relatively recent times.

Following the current trend of corpus approaches to metaphor analysis (Charteris-Black, 2004; Deignan, 2006; Stefanowitsch and Gries, 2006), our study is based on a corpus of English and Spanish financial articles selected from those published during 2007 and the end of 2008 in the English journal The Economist and the Spanish newspaper El Economista. The analysis of the metaphors used in these articles will allow us to show how the same economic reality may be differently conceptualized at different points in time on account of different socio-political factors, such as a Government which, on the verge of national elections, refused to reveal the grim state of affairs of the national economy.},

It provides an account of methods used, problems discovered, and insights gained at the Hamburg Metaphor Database project, intended to inform similar resource creation initiatives, as well as future metaphor processing algorithms. After introducing the project, the theoretical underpinnings that motivate the subdivision of represented information into a conceptual and a lexical level are laid out. The acquisition of metaphor attestations from electronic corpora is explained, and annotation practices as well as database contents are evaluated. The paper concludes with an overview of related projects and an outline of possible future work.},

  abstract = {The aim of this study was to see if and how the intensity of depression correlates with the cognitive representation of notions, and if any influence is reversed during remission. The cognitive representation indices used were the valence and number of metaphors produced for a notion. Three adult groups took part: persons with depression (n=30n = 30), persons in remission (n=12n = 12), and a control group (n=30n = 30). Five notions were considered: PAST, FUTURE, JOY, SADNESS, and HAPPINESS. The Questionnaire of the Metaphorical Conceptualization of a Notion was used. The results showed that (a) depressive subjects did not have problems with metaphorical processing, (b) depressive subjects demonstrated strong interpretational negativism, (c) subjects during remission did not present distorted conceptual processing. The results are discussed in the context of theories of automatic metaphor processing, and conceptions of cognitive depressive distortions, in tasks requiring effort and substantial involvement of cognitive resources.},

  abstract = {The present study analyzes metaphors of life, self, emotional states, and relationships in forty life stories that differ in their communicative situations and narrative goals. Twenty interviews were conducted with people who were seeking psychological help. Another twenty interviews were conducted with Russian celebrities for publication in popular psychology magazines. Metaphors in happy stories were more numerous and diverse than in unhappy stories. Some conceptual metaphors (e.g., “LIFE IS A CONTAINER,” “LIFE IS A JOURNEY,” and “EMOTION IS A PHYSICAL IMPACT”) were found in both happy and unhappy narratives. More specific metaphors demonstrated significant differences between the two types of narratives. The metaphors of life as a “purposeful journey,” self as “alive and flexible object,” and emotional states as “internal and controlled forces” were used more often in happy narratives. This may reflect higher levels of activity, responsibility, and awareness of the authors of happy narratives. Specific for unhappy stories were metaphors “LIFE IS DEATH” and “SELF IS A DEAD OBJECT,” which may indicate a low level of personal well-being and serve as specific markers of personal unhappiness. The results of our study suggest that metaphors may help to construct the subjective reality of happy and unhappy life. By telling their life stories people are able to redefine their past experiences and future perspectives. Specific metaphors play an important part in defining subjective happiness or unhappiness.},

  title = {Foundations of Meaning: {{Primary}} Metaphors and Primary Scenes},
  abstract = {Linguistic evidence reveals strong cognitive links between certain basic concepts, and suggests that these links structure much of conscious, subjective experience.                 The study presented here takes as its starting points two questions about the conceptual theory of metaphor (Lakoff \& Johnson, 1980; etc.): How must the conceptual mappings which underlie metaphorical language be described in order to most accurately account for linguistic data? and, How does the need for plausible motivations constrain these mappings? I propose a new analytical framework--the theory of primary metaphors--which addresses both these questions. If metaphorical language is analyzed in terms of structured mappings between very basic concepts then patterns in metaphorical language are successfully predicted, and patterns of conceptual association (or binding) can be plausibly accounted for in terms of recurring correlations in experience.                 Linguistic evidence shows that the types of concepts which are paired in primary metaphors have distinctive properties: Primary source concepts, like Heaviness, (which provide the vocabulary and imagery of the metaphors) are characterized by schematic image-content--content tied to perceptions and sensations--while primary target concepts, like Difficulty, (i.e. the intended topics of primary metaphorical language) refer to basic cognitive operations, judgments, and responses.                 The experiences which could plausibly motivate the conceptual bindings in primary metaphors are primary scenes--recurrent, basic event-types which involve a tight correlation between perceptual experience and subjective response. These tight correlations--e.g., between the heaviness of objects and the strain we experience in lifting them--are the plausible bases for bindings between concepts, which ultimately give rise to linguistic metaphor.                 The dissertation also explores the possible relevance of primary scenes to other aspects of language, including children's semantic and conceptual development and the organization of basic semantic domains such as spatial relations.                 Most importantly, the findings have implications regarding the nature of subjective mental experience. Given current neurological theories about the nature of thought and reason (e.g., Damasio 1994)--particularly, the central role of images--primary metaphors are implicated as basic building blocks of phenomenological experience. They provide the cognitive link between "objective," bodily experiences and subjective responses to the environment.},

  abstract = {Nearly two thousand perfective verbs in Russian are formed via the addition of so-called “empty prefixes” (čistovidovye pristavki) to imperfective base verbs. The traditional assumption that prefixes are semantically “empty” when used to form aspectual pairs is problematic because the same prefixes are clearly “non-empty” when combined with other base verbs. Though some scholars have suspected that the prefixes are not empty but instead have meanings that overlap with the meanings of the base verbs, proof of this hypothesis has eluded researchers. With the advent of corpora and electronic resources it is possible to explore this question on the basis of large quantities of data. This article presents a new methodology, called “radial category profiling”, in which the semantic network of a prefix is established on the basis of its “non-empty” uses and then compared, node by node, with the semantic network of base verbs that use the same prefix as an “empty” perfectivizing morpheme. This methodology facilitates a comprehensive analysis of ten prefixes, comparing their meanings in “non-empty” and “empty” uses and showing precisely how in the latter case overlap produces the illusion of emptiness. We are able to fully specify the semantic network of each prefix, and discover that for some prefixes there is overlap throughout the network, while for others overlap is restricted to a contiguous subsection of the network. We investigate the dynamic interactions among prefixes, and identify what meanings are incompatible with the “purely aspectual” function of the so-called “empty” prefixes. The results of our analyses, including complete lists of verbs, are publicly available at: http://emptyprefixes.uit.no/ and http://emptyprefixes.uit.no/methodology\_eng.htm.},

While scholars once claimed that this is an ancient inherited system, dating from the prehistoric era, most now believe that the Slavic aspect-pair system is an innovation. Different opinions concerning the date of this innovation range from the time of the earliest Slavic texts to the late middle ages. We use two different statistical models to sort Old Church Slavonic data from the PROIEL corpus and compare the results to distributions of verb forms in modern Russian. This comparison shows that there are indeed differences among verbs in Old Church Slavonic that suggest a division into imperfective vs. perfective verbs, although this division is clearly not identical to the division found in modern Russian.},

  abstract = {We test the hypothesis that Russian verbal prefixes express meaning even when they are used to create a “purely aspectual pair” (čistovidovaja para). This is contrary to traditional assumptions that prefixes in this function are semantically “empty.” We analyze the semantic tags independently established in the Russian National Corpus (www.ruscorpora.ru) for 382 perfective partner verbs with five of the most common verbal prefixes in Russian: po-, s-, za-, na-, and pro-. Statistical tests show that the relationship between prefixes and semantic tags is significant and robust, and further identify which relationships constitute attractions, repulsions, and neutral relationships. It is possible to specify a unique meaning for each prefix in terms of the semantic tags it attracts or repulses. A detailed analysis of all the verbs in the study shows that the meanings of the prefixed perfective partners yield consistent patterns. Even verbs in repulsed semantic classes are consistent with these patterns. The meaning patterns of verbs with “purely aspectual” prefixes can be compared with the meanings of the prefixes as established on the basis of previous scholarship, which was primarily focused on the meanings of prefixes in their “non-empty” uses. This comparison shows that the verb meanings that appear with “purely perfectivizing” prefixes are the same as those found for “non-empty” uses of prefixes. We conclude that verbs select the prefix that is most compatible with their meanings when forming “purely aspectual” perfective partners, confirming our hypothesis.},

  url = {http://gwc2014.ut.ee/lenci_distributional_semantics_gwc2014.pdf},
  abstract = {Distributional Semantics (DS) is a rich family of computational models that build semantic representations of lexical items from their statistical distribution in linguistic contexts. DS is currently experiencing an unprecedented fortune with a growing attention not only in computational linguistics, but also in cognitive science and theoretical linguistics. This is proved by the wide range of DS models that have appeared (e.g., vector spaces, Bayesian models, neural networks, etc.), but even more by the increased number of semantic tasks that these models have been applied to.

DS was born to address a specific issue, that is measuring the semantic similarity of lexical items to be used for thesaurus construction or synonym identification. The Distributional Hypothesis, the main theoretical foundation of DS, is in fact a statement about lexical semantic similarity, which is defined in terms of similarity of linguistic contexts. However, human semantic competence well exceeds the ability to judge lexical similarity. Polysemy, compositionality, inference, semantic creativity are only some of the main phenomena that must be part of the agenda of any full-fledged semantic theory. DS aims at becoming a general model for semantic representation and processing, and therefore it must be evaluated with respect to its ability to explain semantic facts like these. What is the current ability of DS to address these issues? To what extent semantic properties can be modeled in terms of distributional semantic similarity, or alternatively, can DS go beyond the mere notion of semantic similarity? What lies beyond its possibilities? Recently, DS has begun to address issues such as compositionality, polysemy, and semantic relations, but lots of questions remain open. The purpose of this talk is to explore the current boundaries of DS and the chances to enlarge them, in particular by finding new synergies with other types of semantic models.},

Most theories in cognitive science view meaning in terms of propositional structures that may be combined to form higher-order complexes in representing the meanings of conversations and texts. A newer approach seeks to capture meaning in terms of high-dimensional semantic space. Both views reflect the idea that meaning is best understood as abstract and disembodied symbols. My aim in this article is to make the case for an embodied view of linguistic meaning. This view provides a challenge to traditional approaches to linguistic meaning (although may not necessarily be entirely incompatible with them). I discuss several new lines of research from both linguistics and psychology that explore the importance of embodied perception and action in people’s understanding of words, phrases, and texts. These data provide strong evidence in favor of the idea that significant aspects of thought and language arises from, and is grounded in, embodiment.},

  abstract = {The “dead” metaphor view of idiomaticity suggests that idioms were once metaphoric but have lost their metaphoricity over time and now are equivalent to simple literal phrases such that blow your stack = “to get very angry,” crack the whip = “to exert authority,” and spill the beans = “to reveal a secret.” The purpose of the present studies was to demonstrate that idioms are not dead metaphors but have more complex meanings that are motivated by conceptual metaphors linking idiom phrases with their figurative interpretations. Six experiments are reported that examine the difference between idioms and their literal paraphrases. A first study examined people's intuitions about different knowledge domains to illustrate that the meanings of idioms are consistent with the source-to-target domain mappings of the conceptual metaphors that motivate these phrases' figurative meanings. The data from Experiments 2 and 3 indicate that people view idioms as having more complex meanings than do their roughly, equivalent literal paraphrases. Experiments 4 through 6 show that idioms are most appropriate to use and easiest to comprehend when they are encountered in discourse situations that are consistent with the entailments of the conceptual metaphors that motivate these phrases' idiomatic meanings. The findings from these studies suggest that idioms are not dead metaphors with simple figurative interpretations. Instead, idioms have complex meanings that are motivated by independently existing conceptual metaphors that are partly constitutive of everyday thought.},

We present findings from different linguistic and psychological studies showing that people's intuitive sense of pervasive bodily actions constrains their understanding of many types of metaphorical language. More specifically, the precise metaphorical meanings associated with many conventionalized utterances can be explained by an examination of the ways people move and experience their bodies. This diverse set of research findings illustrates the linkages between phenomenological experience, concrete and abstract concepts, and both conventional and poetic uses of language.},

  abstract = {Historical data are essential in fisheries management and conservation, especially for species that suffered significant population declines prior to ecological data collection. Within the field of historical marine ecology, studies have relied on anecdotal evidence, such as written accounts by explorers and interviews of different generations of resource users, to demonstrate the former abundance of certain species and the extent of their ranges. Yet, do we all agree on how these anecdotes are interpreted? This study examines the way that different people interpret anecdotes extracted from historical narratives. We outsource a survey to 50 randomly selected people using Amazon Mechanical Turk (www.mturk.com) and ask them to 'code' historical anecdotes based on their perceived abundance of species. We perform intercoder reliability tests to show that people's perceptions of historical anecdotes are generally consistent. The results speak to the reliability of using people's perceptions to acquire quantitative data, and provide novel insights into the use of anecdotal evidence to inform historical ecology.},

While most Balinese use the absolute frame of reference provided by their language and culture, a relative (egocentric) encoding is also used, and the flexibility with which Balinese can switch from one encoding to the other increases with age. The study thus provides empirical evidence for moderate linguistic relativity.},

The Magus was first published in 1966 and was revised and republished by Fowles in 1977. Fowles' own comment on the second edition was that it was 'rather more than a stylistic revision.' The book explores how the revised version is linguistically different from the original, especially in terms of point of view (re) representation. The corpus stylistic approach adopted combines qualitative and quantitative comparison to confirm the overall text style difference. The analysis demonstrates that computer assisted methods can identify significant linguistic features which literary critics have not noticed and provide a more detailed descriptive basis for literary interpretation of (either edition) of the novel. This analysis of The Magus serves as a case study and exemplar of how corpus techniques may be used generally in the study of linguistics."--Publisher's description},

  abstract = {This research considers the role of indigenous institutions and conceptions of space in the urban design process for producing culturally appropriate designs for Balinese towns. Employing a pluralistic approach (The Image of the City, MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, 1960; Planning a Pluralist City: Conflicting Realities in Ciudad Guyana, MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, 1976; House Form and Culture, Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ, 1969, Human Aspects of the Built Form, Pergamon Press, Oxford, 1977), a case study of the town of Gianyar, Bali, Indonesia explores the popular accounts on the operative indigenous conceptions of space in contemporary Balinese urban settings. This exploration aims at providing a ground for reconnecting urban design proposals with their cultural context, thus promoting the spatially expressed localism originating from the diversity of cultures which is currently undermined by the highly standardized process of the Indonesian planning system. In particular, for the town of Gianyar, such an exploration provides a set of placemaking issues which is useful in devising urban design guidelines for achieving a town with more pronounced cultural identity.

The research concludes that to achieve culturally appropriate places, the design process has to acknowledge the Balinese Hindu psycho-cosmic concept as the core principle in the design of Balinese townscapes. As such, the existing indigenous cosmic territory, which accommodates the relationship between human (microcosm) and environment (macrocosm), along with its adat law and institution, has to be incorporated in contemporary urban design processes. As a result, urban spatial organization, structure and form will significantly reflect the Balinese cultural identity.},

Few verbal metaphoric expressions were found in the data which directly reflected the conceptual metaphors proposed in the models. However, a large number of mostly non-metaphoric expressions were found which constitute entailments of the models. This suggests a form of reasoning according to the logic of the proposed metaphors. The speakers’ metaphoric gestures in one of the debates were then coded and analyzed. Quantitative analysis produced results similar to the linguistic analysis, but qualitative analysis highlighted significant differences between the models, both in terms of their composition and how they can be expressed. The study raises methodological issues for metaphor research, and theoretical questions about the ways of identifying and labeling conceptual metaphors and about the status of cognitive and cultural models.},

Given the metaphorical association between physical cleanliness and moral purity (Zhong \&amp; Liljenquist, 2006), we contend that a clean self may also be linked to a virtuous self. This enhanced moral self-perception can in turn license harsher moral judgment. Three experiments found that cleanliness, whether induced via physical cleansing or through a visualization task, licensed severe judgment on morally contested issues such as abortion and pornography. Further, we found that an inflated moral self mediated the relationship between cleanliness and moral judgment. These results provide unique insight to the social significance of cleanliness and may have important implications for discrimination and prejudice.},

The findings indicate much similarity in conceptual and linguistic metaphors between the two languages, but some differences in the frequency of particular linguistic metaphors. For example, both languages share conceptualisations of the economy as an organism, of market movements as physical movements and of sharp downward market movements as natural disasters. These conceptualisations show in a number of similar lexical metaphors relating to, for example, physical conflict, physical and mental health, mood, extreme weather conditions and earthquakes. However, while in Spanish reporting there is a preference for metaphors based on psychological mood and personality in English reporting there is a higher frequency of nautically based metaphors. There is consideration of the implications of these findings for economists, financial experts, translators, ESP students and those interested in comparative research into metaphor and economics.},

  abstract = {English uses the horizontal spatial metaphors to express time (e.g., the good days ahead of us). Chinese also uses the vertical metaphors (e.g., ‘the month above’ to mean last month). Do Chinese speakers, then, think about time in a different way than English speakers? Boroditsky [Boroditsky, L. (2001). Does language shape thought? Mandarin and English speakers’ conceptions of time. Cognitive Psychology, 43(1), 1–22] claimed that they do, and went on to conclude that ‘language is a powerful tool in shaping habitual thought about abstract domains’ (such as time). By estimating the frequency of usage, we found that Chinese speakers actually use the horizontal spatial metaphors more often than the vertical metaphors. This offered no logical ground for Boroditsky’s claim. We were also unable to replicate her experiments in four different attempts. We conclude that Chinese speakers do not think about time in a different way than English speakers just because Chinese also uses the vertical spatial metaphors to express time.},

  abstract = {This study investigates the intricate polysemy of the Spanish perception verb sentir ('feel') which, analogous to the more-studied visual perception verbs ver ('see') and mirar ('look'), also displays an ample gamut of semantic uses in various syntactic environments. The investigation is based on a corpus-based behavioral profile (BP) analysis. Besides its methodological merits as a quantitative, systematic and verifiable approach to the study of meaning and to polysemy in particular, the BP analysis offers qualitative usage-based evidence for cognitive linguistic theorizing. With regard to the polysemy of sentir, the following questions were addressed: (1) What is the prototype of each cluster of senses? (2) How are the different senses structured: how many senses should be distinguished - i.e., which senses cluster together and which senses should be kept separately? (3) Which senses are more related to each other and which are highly distinguishable? (4) What morphosyntactic variables make them more or less distinguishable? The results show that two significant meaning clusters can be distinguished, which coincide with the division between the middle voice uses ( sentirse) and the other uses ( sentir). Within these clusters, a number of meaningful subclusters emerge, which seem to coincide largely with the more general semantic categories of physical, cognitive and emotional perception.},

  doi = {10.1515/cog-2014-0017},
  abstract = {The present paper reports on an investigation into an English un-participle pattern that is called unpassive, or is described as an adjectival passive. The main characteristic of the pattern is an (adjectival) past participle prefixed by un-, which is used as a predicative complement to a verb. Besides the different terms used for the pattern, there is also some indeterminacy with respect to its particular form. All of the descriptions focus on the verb be, but mention is also made of go and remain. That is, the specifications of the pattern's formal side differ to some extent. To provide information on this issue and to get hold of potential (verb-related) differences in the pattern's function, we conducted an empirical analysis from a usage-based construction grammar perspective. Our focus is on the form-function interplay of the pattern in order to gain information about its constructional status and its exact formal and semantic make-up. The database selected for this study is the BNC, from which all occurrences of 'verb plus un-participle' were extracted. The data were submitted to collexeme and covarying collexeme analyses to identify the spectrum of meanings/functions associated with these forms, and distinctive collexeme analyses were carried out to see whether the un-participles found pattern differently with the individual verbs. The results indicate that, on closer examination, the un-participle construction does not represent a homogeneous category, but must be seen as a schematic template of related, though different, usage events that may have expanded analogously from a prototype construction. On the basis of our analyses and informed by findings from developmental studies, we suggest that the related constructions form a network.},

  abstract = {Metaphors such as icy stare depict social exclusion using cold-related concepts; they are not to be taken literally and certainly do not imply reduced temperature. Two experiments, however, revealed that social exclusion literally feels cold. Experiment 1 found that participants who recalled a social exclusion experience gave lower estimates of room temperature than did participants who recalled an inclusion experience. In Experiment 2, social exclusion was directly induced through an on-line virtual interaction, and participants who were excluded reported greater desire for warm food and drink than did participants who were included. These findings are consistent with the embodied view of cognition and support the notion that social perception involves physical and perceptual content. The psychological experience of coldness not only aids understanding of social interaction, but also is an integral part of the experience of social exclusion. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR},

  abstract = {This study analyses the relationship between four near-synonymous Swedish prepositions, namely angående, beträffande, gällande and rörande, which are used to establish what we call a topic-marking relation, as in statens avtal angående finansieringen ‘the agreement of the state regarding the financing’. By focusing on a single, loosely defined genre consisting of the written texts included in the Swedish PAROLE corpus, we address the question of what differences there are among these four prepositions, which intuitively seem highly similar and mutually interchangeable. In order to find out which contextual and grammatical factors might influence the choice of one preposition over the others, two complementary analyses were performed. First, a so-called collostructional analysis (see Stefanowitsch \& Gries 2003, Gries \& Stefanowitsch 2004) was performed on 791 cases of these prepositions found in the PAROLE corpus. Secondly, the corpus examples were annotated according to ten syntactic and four semantic criteria and a multinomial logistic regression analysis was performed on the annotated data set. The results show some tendencies pointing to differing usage patterns of the four prepositions. Beträffande stands out as the most frequent of them all and is also preferably used when no explicit head element is present, typically in sentence-initial position. Angående prefers words of communication while rörande is used when another topic-marking preposition is also present. On the other hand, neither of the two analyses leads to a clear distinction among the four prepositions, thus pointing to the fact that these topic-marking prepositions indeed constitute a fairly good case of adpositional synonymy, with few distinguishing factors separating one from the other.},

  abstract = {Identifying metaphorically used words in the way we have proposed in the other articles in this special issue inevitably leads to the detection of recurring structural patterns of metaphor usage. It is the aim of the present article to explore these patterns in a systematic fashion and develop a taxomony of the propositional structure of metaphors. As a preliminary step, a decision has to be made about the units of discourse within which one may examine patterns of the propositional structure of metaphorical language. This article has adopted the position that all non-downgraded clauses, in the manner of Mann and Thompson’s Rhetorical Structure Theory (1988), would be the most eligible candidate.
Inside the boundaries of these text units, we have found single as opposed to multiple metaphor, simple as opposed to complex metaphor, pure as opposed to mixed metaphor, and restricted as opposed to extended metaphor. Moreover, these four oppositions may also be combined with each other. Of the 16 logically possible combinations, 2 are ruled out, but the other 14 combinations present just as many structural types of metaphor.
We then move on to discuss how such a taxonomy may be used in the quantitative characterization of the metaphorical style of an author. We show how the taxonomy may be applied at various levels of measurement, ranging from the word through the proposition to the text unit itself. Another possibility is to perform these measurements at the level of metaphorical mappings, which is the option we have chosen to apply to two stretches of fiction, by Sara Maitland and Salman Rushdie. The provisional results of this analysis are then finally presented and discussed.},

  abstract = {This article is an overview of the approach to metaphor analysis expounded in the following three articles. Until now the study of conceptual metaphor has been based mainly on the evidence of invented linguistic examples. Although the great value of the work done within this framework is clear, a more empirically oriented approach will need to engage with metaphorical language in naturally occurring discourse. To study this an explicit analytic procedure is required. Although such a procedure should ultimately provide a new source of evidence for underlying cognitive processes, it will not provide a direct path from linguistic to cognitive reality. When our group classifies an instance of language as metaphorical we thus do not claim that it realizes a psychologically real conceptual metaphor, but only that it provides the linguistic basis for such a realization. In specifying the conceptual metaphorical potential of this linguistic basis, we have found the tools of propositional analysis, as developed by discourse psychology, as well as the concept of cross-domain mapping familiar in cognitive semantics, to be extremely useful. Our approach to metaphor analysis thus has three levels: that of metaphorical language; that of the metaphorical proposition; and that of the cross-domain mapping.},

  abstract = {This article aims to demonstrate the possibility of a stepwise procedure for metaphor identification. It is situated against the background of a more encompassing and complete five-step procedure for deriving conceptual metaphorical mappings from linguistic metaphors. The mainly cognitive linguistic assumptions of this overall approach are explicated first, with an emphasis on the purpose of identifying metaphor in language rather than in language behaviour. The compatibility between this cognitive-linguistic and a more generally cognitive psychological approach to metaphor is guaranteed by then introducing the notion of metaphorical propositions as the bridge between linguistic metaphors and metaphorical mappings. Moreover, reliability is hopefully increased by adopting the strategy of beginning with clear cases, which means that the initial focus is on all nominal, verbal, adjectival and adverbial concepts. As a result of this, a minimal procedure for finding metaphorically used words and concepts may be presented in the form of a list of seven instructions. A demonstration of this procedure is finally provided in the form of a detailed analysis of Robert Browning’s ‘Parting at Morning’.},

The study reveals that the different senses of a verb tend to be attracted to different constructions and that integrating sense into the analysis not only makes the interpretation of the data more straightforward and more reliable, but also provides information that would otherwise have to be obtained by means of other techniques.},

Stefanowitsch and Gries 2003) which has gained considerable popularity among corpus linguists and especially cognitive linguists with a statistical bent. For many less statisti-cally minded linguists, it has proven rather difficult to evaluate the theoretical background assumptions and cognitive underpinnings of collostructional analy-sis and to compare them to alternative ways of modelling lexicogrammatical at-traction phenomena. This paper aims to spell out these premises and founda-tions in terms comprehensible to a wider audience. It begins with a concise survey of how collostructional analysis works and then reports on a number of practical, theoretical and statistical issues of which both practitioners of the method and those who try to appreciate results of its application should be aware. With these issues in mind we then discuss alternative ways of calculating and interpreting lexicogrammatical attraction. The advantages and disadvantages of the different methods are discussed, also against the background of the results of studies that have tried to evaluate the measures by means of external evidence from psycho-linguistic experiments. Finally, cognitive underpinnings of lexicogrammatical associations and implications for the different approaches are discussed. It is argued that at present we lack adequate knowledge about the ways in which dis-course frequencies affect entrenchment. We conclude that the complexities of the relation between corpus frequencies and degrees of entrenchment are still rather poorly understood, and make suggestions for future work.},

In section 1 we list a number of general issues involved in metaphor identification. In sections 2 and 3 we examine two short fictional extracts from novels written in the 1990s (one from popular fiction and one from serious fiction), relating our detailed analyses to the general questions raised at the beginning of the article. We thus raise and exemplify a series of issues which do not have easy resolutions but which must be grasped (a) if a corpus-based approach to metaphor is to become a reality and (b) if the relations between conceptual and linguistic metaphors are to be fully understood. Interestingly, this attempt to be extremely detailed and systematic in turn leads us to comment on differences in aesthetic effects between the use of metaphors in the two extracts examined.},

  abstract = {This article contributes to cognitive semantic research on the construal of figurative meaning in noun-noun compounds. Previous studies in this field have shown a predilection towards using conceptual blending theory in order to describe the process of meaning formation in nominal compounds. Observations have largely been based on analyses of established compounds and their conventionalized meanings. The current paper explores an alternative approach and methodology. A study was conducted in which participants were asked to interpret the meaning of a set of novel noun-noun compounds. These meaning descriptions are taken as an empirical base to investigate figurative interpretations. Since previous applications of conceptual blending theory have highlighted some limitations of describing meaning construal in compounds, and since the relation between conceptual blending and related processes of conceptual metaphor and metonymy has not been clarified yet, the analysis in the current study takes a step back and relies on conceptual metaphor and metonymy. Besides providing an overview of the amount of figurative meaning interpretations given to the different test items, the paper pays particular attention to the methodological challenges of applying conceptual metaphor and metonymy theory in the attempt to capture the figurative nature of the meaning descriptions. A close analysis of selected meaning interpretations provides a first impression on how applying conceptual metaphor and metonymy can pave the way towards a more differentiated understanding of associative complexity in figurative meaning interpretations.},

  abstract = {This paper examines the (non)metonymic usage of capital names in news articles from Mainland Chinese and Taiwan Chinese and shows that this phenomenon is actually more complex than might have been expected. We annotated capital names extracted from a self-built news corpus with insights from previous studies on place name metonymies in Cognitive Linguistics and identified factors that would influence their (non)metonymic usage. To quantitatively explore the data, logistic regression analysis was employed. The statistical results reveal that the variation in the (non)metonymic capital names is a result of an intricate interplay of a number of conceptual, lectal and discursive factors: (1) more metonymic capital names are found in subject than non-subject position and in political than non-political news topics; types of capital may influence their metonymic usage; (2) differences between Mainland Chinese and Taiwan Chinese cannot be ignored, especially for the interpretation of a specific metonymy, i.e. CAPITAL FOR GOVERNMENT; (3) the (non)metonymic usage of a capital name is also determined by its sequencing and location in discourse. We hope this study may shed some light on the usage-based trend of current Cognitive Linguistics, i.e. investigating metonymy in authentic linguistic data by a range of empirical methodologies.},

The researchers claim that speakers associated more stereotypically female adjectives with grammatically feminine nouns and more stereotypically male adjectives with grammatically masculine nouns. We were not able to replicate the results either in a word association task or in an analogous primed lexical decision task. This suggests that the results of the original experiment were either an artifact of some non-documented aspect of the experimental procedure or a statistical fluke. The question whether speakers assign sex-based interpretations to grammatical gender categories at all cannot be answered definitively, as the results in the published literature vary considerably. However, our experiments show that if such an effect exists, it is not strong enough to be measured indirectly via the priming of adjectives by nouns.},

Many of the experimental tasks used in psychology to demonstrate the psychological reality of conceptual metaphors reflect intricate couplings between cognitive and social processes. This argument demands a reorientation in how metaphor scholars interpret empirical findings related to conceptual metaphor theory, and more broadly aims to dissolve the long-standing theoretical divide between metaphoric cognition and metaphoric communication.},

This paper aims to demonstrate how general rules for determining basic meanings can be formulated in large-scale projects involving multiple analysts applying MIP(VU) to authentic data. Three sets of problematic lexical units -- chemical processes, colours, and sharp objects -- are discussed in relation to the question of how the basic meaning of a lexical unit can be determined when human and non-human senses compete as candidates for the basic meaning; these analyses can therefore be considered a detailed case study of problems encountered during step 3.b. of MIP(VU). The analyses show how these problematic cases were tackled in a large corpus clean-up project in order to streamline the annotations and ensure a greater consistency of the corpus. In addition, this paper will point out how the formulation of general identification rules and guidelines could provide a first step towards the automatic detection of linguistic metaphors in natural discourse.},

Much work in contemporary cognitive science suggests that people’s introspections about their beliefs, feelings, and the reasons for their actions are quite inaccurate. Even trained experts often fail to recognize the real reasons for their beliefs and actions. The simple fact is that our ability to introspect upon many cognitive processes is extremely limited. This article discusses the implications of this empirical evidence for cognitive linguistic research and theory. I suggest several ways, nonetheless, by which cognitive linguists can better contribute to interdisciplinary scholarship by more systematically exploring the nature and reasons for their introspections on language and thought.},

It is shown that it is very difficult to identify separable senses, which calls into question whether say is actually a realisation of a mapping from writing to speaking. A dictionary developed on corpus principles is a good alternative to using corpus data directly.

  abstract = {Over the last two decades, accumulating work in cognitive science and cognitive linguistics has provided evidence that language shapes thought. Conceptual metaphor theory proposes that the conceptual structure of emotions emerges through metaphorization from concrete concepts such as spatial orientation and physical containment. Primary metaphors for emotions have been described in a wide range of languages. Here we show, in Study 1, the results of a corpus analysis revealing that certain metaphors such as EMOTIONS ARE FLUIDS and EMOTIONS ARE BOUNDED SPACES are quite natural in Spanish. Moreover, the corpus data reveal that the bounded space source domain is more frequently mapped onto negative emotions. In Study 2, we consider the question of whether the instantiation of metaphorical framing influences the way we think about emotions. A questionnaire experiment was conducted to explore this question, focusing on the Spanish case of locura ('madness'). Our results show that when madness was framed as a fluid filling a container (the body), people tended to rate symptoms as less enduring and as more likely to be caused by social and environmental factors, compared with when it was framed as a place in space. Results are discussed in the light of conceptual metaphor theory.},

  abstract = {In this article I provide an account of the way in which the domain of spoken communication is metaphorically constructed in English, on the basis of the analysis of over 450 metaphorical references to speech activity in a corpus of contemporary written British English. I show how spoken communication is mainly structured via a set of source domains that conventionally apply to a wide variety of target domains, such as the source domains of MOTION, PHYSICAL TRANSFER, PHYSICAL CONSTRUCTION, and PHYSICAL SUPPORT. Each of these source domains structures a particular aspect of speech activity, such as the achievement of communicative goals, the expression of meanings and ideas, the performance of speech acts, the negotiation of mutual relationships, and so on. I suggest that the particular conceptual mappings that underlie the main patterns in my data are best seen in terms of Grady's (1997) notion of primary metaphors, that is, as simple, basic mappings that have a firm experiential basis and that apply to a wide range of different areas of experience (e.g., "HELP/ASSISTANCE IS SUPPORT"). However, I also show that the main primary metaphors involved in structuring the domain of speech activity can be combined into a single overall physical scenario in which interactants can move in different directions, place themselves in different positions in relation to each other, come into contact with each other in different ways, physically produce texts/utterances/speech acts, physically pass texts/utterances/speech acts to each other, and make meanings visible to each other in different ways. Finally, I argue that a corpus-based methodology has much to offer to metaphor research, particularly in the extrapolation of conceptual metaphors from linguistic data.},

I concluded that the ultimate source domain (experiential basis) is the world of physical objects. The present paper develops these ideas, presenting a more detailed analysis of each of the metaphor types. Thus, I claim that the concrete-to-concrete metaphors are based on metonymy and abstract-to-concrete on the OBJECT schema. Abstract-to-abstract metaphorization falls into two traditional types: structural and orientational metaphors. As to the former, I show that the vague expressions "more concrete domain" or "more abstract domain" can be made clearer by considering the ontological status of the component elements of the domain: the "more concrete" domain has more elements of physical ontology. Orientational metaphors have been found to be only superficially orientational, their true objective being valuation. I conclude that all these metaphor types eventually refer to the world of physical objects for their experiential basis.},

However, they have also been criticized for their potentially negative implications. The use of innovative methodology enables us to undertake a more rigorous and systematic investigation of Violence metaphors than has previously been possible. Our findings show that patients, carers and professionals use a much wider set of Violence-related metaphors than noted in previous studies, and that metaphor use varies between interview and online forum genres and amongst different stakeholder groups. Our study has implications for the computer-assisted study of metaphor, metaphor theory and analysis more generally, and communication in healthcare settings.},

Much of how Construction Grammar incorporates pragmatic considerations of contextual factors into its descriptions of speakers' linguistic knowledge remains to be worked out. In order to take a step towards that goal, this corpus-based study presents the just me construction and analyzes it from compositional, semantic and pragmatic perspectives. The study first delivers an in-depth description of the constrained and conventionalized composition of the construction. Then it proposes that the intricate semantic content is the result of formal and conceptual blending of the alternative question construction and the truncated it-cleft construction. Third, the pragmatic aspects of the just me construction are analyzed in terms of its hedging function, possible response patterns, and the conventionalized nature of its non-compositional meaning. All contribute to the recognition of the just me construction as a symbolic unit in the grammar of English. In conclusion, after a summary of the points made in previous sections, the insights gleaned from the present case study will be used to reflect in more general terms on the role of pragmatic considerations of contextual factors in Construction Grammar.},

We find that non-literal expressions with a relatively fixed form and highly specific semantics and pragmatics are very frequent in our data but are not well accounted for by current cognitive metaphor theory. We term these non-literal expressions ‘metaphoremes’, and argue that they represent the coalescence of linguistic, semantic, affective, and pragmatic forces into attractor states in the discourse system, appearing in discourse as relatively stable bundles of patterns of use. We show a metaphoreme emerging in the course of a discourse event and another which appears to have emerged recently as a result of a changing social environment. We then combine analyses and data types to track the use of $<$walk away from$>$ as a metaphoreme, showing its patterns of formal, semantic, affective, and pragmatic characteristics.},

  abstract = {At first glance, subject-verb-agreement seems to be straightforward in German: In the case of simplex NPs, the subject always agrees with the verb syntactically in person and number. However, with coordinated NPs in subject position, there is considerable variation in usage. If both conjuncts are singular NPs, the verb may display singular agreement - as would be expected, since coordinated structures inherit their syntactic properties from their individual components - but much more frequently, the verb displays plural agreement. On the basis of the LIMAS-corpus, a one-million-word corpus of written German, I will show that there is systematic variation between the two options. Among the determining factors are the position of the verb (preceding or following the subject), the type of NP (pronoun, proper name, lexical NP) and the internal syntactic structure of the subject (coordination of full NPs vs. coordination of partial NPs sharing a determiner, and definiteness vs. indefiniteness of the coordinated parts of the subject). I will discuss the results from the perspective of usage-based approaches and argue for an integration of semantic, pragmatic, and frequency factors in any theoretical approach to grammar.},

  shorttitle = {More on the As-Predicative},
  abstract = {Usage-based construction grammar needs to determine which schematizations are really supported by usage: Previous research on argumentstructure constructions with object-related complements has assumed overarching constructions with a formally underspecified component (Gries et al. 2005, 2010; Gonzalvez-Garcia 2009). These schematize over a number of formally different subconstructions. It has been shown, however, that paying attention to the formally different realisations of a constructional component may bring out the functional differential between subconstructions which are closely related within a construction network (Hampe 2011a). Based on the data used by Gries and colleagues (2010), this paper presents a fine-grained collostruction analysis of the as-predicative as a network of tightly related subconstructions and checks whether there is a functional difference between the subconstructions with nominal and adjectival as-complements. It is shown that the extended uses of the construction sketched out by Gries et al. (2005) are licensed by the subconstruction with nominal as-complement, rather than present a property of the overarching, most general pattern. Beyond this, the present paper locates the as-predicative within the network of all argument-structure constructions with phrasal object-related complements. In this context, it also discusses under which conditions the occurrence of a specific verb as a collexeme of more than one argument-structure construction can be seen as a verb-specific constructeme uniting several allostructions (Capelle 2006).},

Finally, the issue of to what extent the syntactic behaviour of verbs can be predicted from their meaning is taken up and it is shown that Goldberg's Semantic Coherence Principle and Correspondence Principle have to be supplemented by a Valency Realisation Principle.},

  abstract = {This paper deals with V-N-conversion in the Romance languages from a cognitive and constructional perspective. In contrast to English, the Romance languages distinguish different types of V-N-conversion on the basis of morphological and semantic properties: a stem conversion type and two types of nominalized infinitives. The critical discussion of earlier cognitive approaches to conversion leads to a comprehensive synchronic and diachronic description of all Romance V-N-conversion types, taking into account both the differences with respect to boundedness and the occurrence of metonymic meanings. On these grounds the syntactic type of the nominalized infinitive is modeled within the framework of Construction Grammar and its lexicalization as an instance of constructional change.},

Some scientists have argued that language is innate, a type of unique human 'instinct' pre-programmed in us from birth. In this book, Vyvyan Evans argues that this received wisdom is, in fact, a myth. Debunking the notion of a language 'instinct', Evans demonstrates that language is related to other animal forms of communication; that languages exhibit staggering diversity; that we learn our mother tongue drawing on general properties and abilities of the human mind, rather than an inborn 'universal' grammar; and that, ultimately, language and the mind reflect and draw upon the way we interact with others in the world. Compellingly written and drawing on cutting-edge research, The Language Myth sets out a forceful alternative to the received wisdom, showing how language and the mind really work"--},

The analysis demonstrates the validity of Fillmore's distinction between meaning proper and associated presuppositions, and it also demonstrates the pertinence of associated case frames and the viability of case categories proposed by Fillmore. The only additional concepts needed to capture the semantic relationship between the four entries appear to be the ones represented by the oppositions Inferior/Superior, Self/Non-Self, and Property/Activity. The analysis suggests the hypothesis that these oppositions constitute core concepts in the lexicon of psychological phenomena in Russian and perhaps in other languages as well.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.pragma.2003.10.011},
  abstract = {This paper argues that ‘active metaphors’ can be sharply distinguished from other metaphorical phenomena due to their reliance on ‘metalexical awareness’, detectable by linguistic tests as well as by intuition. Far from being a natural function of the human mind or a universal of rational communication, I contend that active metaphorizing is a culture-specific speech practice which demands explication within an ethnopragmatic perspective. I propose an ethnopragmatic script (a kind of specialized cultural script) for active metaphorizing in English, and dramatize its culture-specificity by ethnopragmatic case studies of Pitjantjatjara (central Australia) and Malay. Finally, in relation to English active metaphors, I try to demonstrate that expository metaphors have determinable meanings which can be stated as extended reductive paraphrases. The analytical framework is the natural semantic metalanguage theory [C. Goddard, A. Wierzbicka (Eds.), Meaning and Universal Grammar—Theory and Empirical Findings, 2 vols., John Benjamins, Amsterdam, 2002; A. Wierzbicka, Semantics: Primes and Universals, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1996a], and the associated theory of cultural scripts.},

  doi = {10.1075/eww.30.1.03muk},
  abstract = {The present paper investigates the strength of verb-construction associations across various New Englishes on the basis of comparable corpora. In contrast to previous studies into verb complementation in New Englishes, we start off from three basic constructions in English — the intransitive, the monotransitive and the ditransitive construction — and analyse the co-occurrences of the three constructions and a wide range of verbs. The present study is based on the Hong Kong, the Indian, and the Singapore components of the International Corpus of English (ICE) because the three varieties represent markedly different stages in the process of the evolution of New Englishes with British English as the historical input variety. Our quantitative analysis includes multiple distinctive collexeme analyses for the different varieties. The results show, inter alia, that, firstly, processes of structural nativisation of New Englishes can also be observed at the level of verb-construction associations, which can be subsumed under the notion of “collostructional nativisation”, and that, secondly, there are identifiable intervarietal differences between British English and New Englishes as well as between individual New Englishes. In general, there is a correlation between the evolutionary stage of a New English variety and its collostructional nativisation: The more advanced a New English variety is in the developmental cycle, the more dissimilar its collostructional preferences are to British English.},

  shorttitle = {Right and Wrong},
  abstract = {One of the most interesting phenomena in the history of the English language is the remarkable rise of the word right, in its many interrelated senses and uses. This article tries to trace the changes in the meaning and use of this word, as well as the rise of new conversational routines based on right, and raises questions about the cultural underpinnings of these semantic and pragmatic developments. It explores the hypothesis that the `discourse of truth' declined in English over the centuries; that the use of `right' and `wrong' as parallel concepts (and opposites) increased; and it notes that the use of right as an adjective increased enormously in relation to the use of true . Originally, right meant `straight', as in a right line (straight line). Figuratively, perhaps, this right in the sense `straight' was also used in an evaluative sense: `good', with an additional component building on the geometrical image: `clearly good'. Spoken of somebody else's words, “right” was linked (implicitly or explicitly) with `true'. But in the course of the 17th and 18th centuries right appears to have begun to be used more and more with reference to thinking rather than speaking. The association of right with thinking seems to have spread in parallel with a contrastive use of right and wrong — a trend apparently encouraged by the influence of the Reformation, especially within its Calvinist wing. Another interesting development is that over the last two centuries or so the discourse of `right' and `wrong' appears to have found a competitor in a discourse of `cooperation' and mutual concessions. Judging by both the frequency and range of its use, the word right flourished in this atmosphere, whereas wrong was increasingly left behind. This article traces the transition from the Shakespearean response “Right.”, described by the OED as `you are right; you speak well', to the present-day “Right.” of non-committal acknowledgement and it links the developments in semantics and discourse patterns with historical phenomena such as Puritanism, British empiricism, the Enlightenment and the growth of democracy.},

Here we describe an influential theory of embodied cognition according to which thoughts are implemented in perceptuo-motor simulations, in the brain’s modality-specific systems. This theory is invoked in nearly every paper on “embodied metaphor,” across linguistics, philosophy, psychology, and cognitive neuroscience. There appears to be overwhelming support for the conclusion that representations of metaphorical “source domains” are embodied in perceptuo-motor simulations. Here we show, however, that when the data are evaluated appropriately there is very little evidence that metaphors are embodied in this sense. The kind of data that offer compelling support for the embodiment of concrete, literal ideas like “grasping the ball” are nearly absent for abstract, metaphorical ideas like “grasping the explanation.” There is now abundant evidence that metaphors structure our thoughts, feelings, and choices in a variety of conceptual domains. But evidence for metaphorical mental representation is not necessarily evidence for embodiment. If any metaphorical source domains are embodied in modality-specific simulations, they may be the exception rather than the rule.},

  abstract = {Linguistic convention typically allows speakers several options. Evidence is accumulating that the various options are preferred in different contexts, yet the criteria governing the selection of the appropriate form are often far from obvious. Most researchers who attempt to discover the factors determining a preference rely on the linguistic analysis and statistical modeling of data extracted from large corpora. In this paper, we address the question of how to evaluate such models and explicitly compare the performance of a statistical model derived from a corpus with that of native speakers in selecting one of six Russian TRY verbs. Building on earlier work we trained a polytomous logistic regression model to predict verb choice given the sentential context. We compare the predictions the model makes for 60 unseen sentences to the choices adult native speakers make in those same sentences. We then look in more detail at the interplay of the contextual properties and model computationally how individual differences in assessing the importance of contextual properties may impact the linguistic knowledge of native speakers. Finally, we compare the probability the model assigns to encountering each of the six verbs in the 60 test sentences to the acceptability ratings the adult native speakers give to those sentences. We discuss the implications of our findings for both usage-based theory and empirical linguistic methodology.},

It employs R, a free software environment for statistical computing, which is increasingly popular among linguists. How to do Linguistics with R: Data exploration and statistical analysis is unique in its scope, as it covers a wide range of classical and cutting-edge statistical methods, including different flavours of regression analysis and ANOVA, random forests and conditional inference trees, as well as specific linguistic approaches, among which are Behavioural Profiles, Vector Space Models and various measures of association between words and constructions. The statistical topics are presented comprehensively, but without too much technical detail, and illustrated with linguistic case studies that answer non-trivial research questions. The book also demonstrates how to visualize linguistic data with the help of attractive informative graphs, including the popular ggplot2 system and Google visualization tools.},

Consequently, a variable's real effect can be concealed when studied in isolation because of the exclusion of the impact of other potentially confounding variables. Analyzing a variational case study, the alternation between inflected and uninflected attributive adjectives in Dutch, it will be demonstrated how confounding variables alter the impact of explanatory variables on the response variable, resulting in spurious effects in the bivariate analyses. Multiple Correspondence Analysis will be used as a heuristic tool to unveil the association patterns between explanatory variables in the data matrix which induce the spurious effects. Based on these findings, we will argue for a thorough analysis of the database patterns to gain insight in the underlying associations between explanatory variables before modeling their real impact on the response variable in a multivariate model.},

The findings showed that English and Persian share many metaphorical expressions of happiness that are based on common bodily experiences. Consequently, the similarities can be attributed to the universality of conceptual metaphors, whereas differences in metaphorical expressions relate to specific different cultural modes in English and Persian.},

Discussing a range of quite subtle meanings and uses of these prepositions in different types of discourse (or genre), it provides a complete descriptive account of prepositional meanings that reflects more closely the range of actual uses by speakers in spoken and written discourses. It addresses important semantic and pragmatic issues including polysemy, sense distinction, conceptual and non-conceptual aspects of preposition use, borrowing and semantic change, context and inferences. The issue of preposition alternation, which has received little attention in previous studies, is discussed in terms of the interplay between overlaps in the semantic range and pragmatic as well as discourse-related factors." -- Back cover.},

The EAT/FEED frame forms part of a taxonomy of frames including the superordinate CONSUME frame and subordinate frames of human vs. animal eating; constructional and metaphor data in the corpus shows that English covertly distinguishes human and animal eating. The EAT frame includes three phases (intake, process, and ingest), differentiated lexicogrammatically. The EAT frame also includes three domains in its domain matrix: physical, biological (nutritional) and social, all clearly differentiated by distinct constructions in the corpus. An examination of metaphors with eat and feed in the corpus demonstrate that the target domain contributes image-schematic structure to the metaphorical mapping, contrary to the Invariance Hypothesis.},

In this study, we employ the Metaphor Identification Procedure (Pragglejaz Group 2007) to identify all metaphors involving sex and religion in Shakespeare's Hamlet and its three Franco-era Spanish translations. We find that under the influence of censorship, authors employ many of the strategies for metaphor translation also used for uncensored texts, such as those identified by Newmark (1981), van den Broeck (1981), and Toury (1995). However, we argue that censorship encourages strategies judged as less preferable, more extreme, or which are not usually discussed in translation studies. These strategies appear to be selected specifically to remove the material subject to censorship, whether this is found in the source domain (vehicle) or the target domain (tenor) of a metaphor.},

  abstract = {Metaphoric expressions are not all equal, in the sense that some are intuitively more or less metaphoric than others. Part of this intuition is influenced by the underlying metaphor, but another part is influenced by the linguistic expression which carries that metaphor. This paper puts forward a system, first, of dividing the two important elements which contribute to gradient intuitions of metaphoricity. These are (1) the density of the metaphor in the surface semantic content of the expression and (2) elements of the relationship between source and target in the underlying metaphor. Second, the paper puts forward a system for measuring the overall metaphoricity of an expression. This is a comparative system which can replicate intuitions that any two expressions have either equal or varying degrees of metaphoricity. The most interesting conclusion which can be drawn from intuitions of metaphoricity is that there are multiple factors with equal influence on metaphoricity. These factors can create conspiracies which disguise the strength of the underlying metaphor.},

  shorttitle = {Vector {{Space Models}} of {{Word Meaning}} and {{Phrase Meaning}}},
  abstract = {Distributional models represent a word through the contexts in which it has been observed. They can be used to predict similarity in meaning, based on the distributional hypothesis, which states that two words that occur in similar contexts tend to have similar meanings. Distributional approaches are often implemented in vector space models. They represent a word as a point in high-dimensional space, where each dimension stands for a context item, and a word's coordinates represent its context counts. Occurrence in similar contexts then means proximity in space. In this survey we look at the use of vector space models to describe the meaning of words and phrases: the phenomena that vector space models address, and the techniques that they use to do so. Many word meaning phenomena can be described in terms of semantic similarity: synonymy, priming, categorization, and the typicality of a predicate's arguments. But vector space models can do more than just predict semantic similarity. They are a very flexible tool, because they can make use of all of linear algebra, with all its data structures and operations. The dimensions of a vector space can stand for many things: context words, or non-linguistic context like images, or properties of a concept. And vector space models can use matrices or higher-order arrays instead of vectors for representing more complex relationships. Polysemy is a tough problem for distributional approaches, as a representation that is learned from all of a word's contexts will conflate the different senses of the word. It can be addressed, using either clustering or vector combination techniques. Finally, we look at vector space models for phrases, which are usually constructed by combining word vectors. Vector space models for phrases can predict phrase similarity, and some argue that they can form the basis for a general-purpose representation framework for natural language semantics.},

  abstract = {The literary imagination may take flight on the wings of metaphor, but hard-headed scientists are just as likely as doe-eyed poets to reach for a metaphor when the descriptive need arises. Metaphor is a pervasive aspect of every genre of text and every register of speech, and is as useful for describing the inner workings of a "black hole" (itself a metaphor) as it is the affairs of the human heart. The ubiquity of metaphor in natural language thus poses a significant challenge for Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems and their builders, who cannot afford to wait until the problems of literal language have been solved before turning their attention to figurative phenomena. This book offers a comprehensive approach to the computational treatment of metaphor and its figurative brethren - including simile, analogy, and conceptual blending - that does not shy away from their important cognitive and philosophical dimensions. Veale, Shutova, and Beigman Klebanov approach metaphor from multiple computational perspectives, providing coverage of both symbolic and statistical approaches to interpretation and paraphrase generation, while also considering key contributions from philosophy on what constitutes the "meaning" of a metaphor. This book also surveys available metaphor corpora and discusses protocols for metaphor annotation. Any reader with an interest in metaphor, from beginning researchers to seasoned scholars, will find this book to be an invaluable guide to what is a fascinating linguistic phenomenon.},

  abstract = {The ubiquity of metaphor in language (Lakoff and Johnson 1980) has served as impetus for cognitive linguistic approaches to the study of language, mind, and the study of mind (e.g. Thibodeau \& Boroditsky 2011). While native speakers use metaphor naturally and easily, the treatment and interpretation of metaphor in computational systems remains challenging because such systems have not succeeded in developing ways to recognize the semantic elements that define metaphor. This tutorial demonstrates MetaNet’s frame-based semantic analyses, and their informing of MetaNet’s automatic metaphor identification system. Participants will gain a complete understanding of the theoretical basis and the practical workings of MetaNet, and acquire relevant information about the Frame Semantics basis of that knowledge base and the way that FrameNet handles the widespread phenomenon of metaphor in language. The tutorial is geared to researchers and practitioners of language technology, not necessarily experts in metaphor analysis or knowledgeable about either FrameNet or MetaNet, but who are interested in natural language processing tasks that involve automatic metaphor processing, or could benefit from exposure to tools and resources that support frame-based deep semantic, analyses of language, including metaphor as a widespread phenomenon in human language.},

The main point of this paper is the claim that a constructional view needs to take account of the mutual associations between modal auxiliaries and the lexical elements with which they occur. Changes in these mutual associations are usefully understood as change in a complex network of constructions.},

  abstract = {When speakers are confronted with modal expressions in their native language, specifically those that contain a modal verb, they are able to interpret these expressions as epistemic or non-epistemic, for example. But what enables the speakers to interpret these modal expressions instantly and accurately despite the inevitably complex explanation any linguistic theory needs to evoke to account for this? Modality, modals, and modal interpretations are among those universal tension points where the explanatory value of any theoretical construct is sorely tested. This paper raises some questions about the adequacy of applying Construction Grammar (Goldberg 1995, 2006) as a method of analysis of expressions containing modal verbs. In particular, the following issues are discussed: (i) the necessity to postulate a great number of constructions to account for a modal utterance, (ii) the theoretically unrestricted scope of a construction, and (iii) the ever-present problem of indeterminate modal utterances.},

  abstract = {My aim in this paper is to show that, in modified form, semantic connectivity maps of the kind developed in van der Auwera \& Plungian (1998) and van der Auwera (2013) can be useful for showing the development over time of relationships among polysemous constructions. Since these maps pertain primarily to meaning and are intended as contributions to cross-linguistic generalizations rather than to language-specific grammars, their purpose might seem orthogonal to construction grammar, in which form–meaning pairs are the basic units of grammar. I propose that the semantic maps can usefully be rethought as being of two kinds: schema-construction maps that represent relationships between abstract, conceptual schemas linked to underspecified form, and micro-construction maps that represent relationships between specific constructions. These two kinds of maps capture both form and meaning since they represent form–meaning pairings, but at different levels of abstraction. They can also capture direction of changes, as tendencies at the schema level and specific trajectories at the micro-level. My case study is the development of the marginal modals BETTER, RATHER, SOONER (see Denison \& Cort 2010, van der Auwera \& De Wit 2010). I show that better is significantly different in distribution and meaning from rather and sooner, and that, although they form a family of micro-constructions, they do not form a tight-knit group. This can be captured well by modified semantic maps.},

Short-circuitedness is evidenced by the humorous effect that is obtained when a character wilfully or unknowingly ignores standard aspects of interpretation of such a modal verb construction.},

However, many studies use incorrect statistical procedures, fail to fully report the information necessary to interpret their results, or do not address how IRR affects the power of their subsequent analyses for hypothesis testing. This paper provides an overview of methodological issues related to the assessment of IRR with a focus on study design, selection of appropriate statistics, and the computation, interpretation, and reporting of some commonly-used IRR statistics. Computational examples include SPSS and R syntax for computing Cohen’s kappa and intra-class correlations to assess IRR.},

  abstract = {There is mounting evidence that language comprehension involves the activation of mental imagery of the content of utterances (Barsalou, 1999; Bergen, Chang, \& Narayan, 2004; Bergen, Narayan, \& Feldman, 2003; Narayan, Bergen, \& Weinberg, 2004; Richardson, Spivey, McRae, \& Barsalou, 2003; Stanfield \& Zwaan, 2001; Zwaan, Stanfield, \& Yaxley, 2002). This imagery can have motor or perceptual content. Three main questions about the process remain under-explored, however. First, are lexical associations with perception or motion sufficient to yield mental simulation, or is the integration of lexical semantics into larger structures, like sentences, necessary? Second, what linguistic elements (e.g., verbs, nouns, etc.) trigger mental simulations? Third, how detailed are the visual simulations that are performed? A series of behavioral experiments address these questions, using a visual object categorization task to investigate whether up- or down-related language selectively interferes with visual processing in the same part of the visual field (following Richardson et al., 2003). The results demonstrate that either subject nouns or main verbs can trigger visual imagery, but only when used in literal sentences about real space—metaphorical language does not yield significant effects—which implies that it is the comprehension of the sentence as a whole and not simply lexical associations that yields imagery effects. These studies also show that the evoked imagery contains detail as to the part of the visual field where the described scene would take place.},

Although the basic constructs of ``concept'', ``domain'', ``construal'', and ``category structure'' go by dierent names, they are essentially the same among researchers in cognitive linguistics. We examine a fth theoretical construct, that of ``image schemas'' (recurring basic conceptual structures), and argue that image schemas are a subtype of domain. We begin with the theory of domains proposed by Langacker, which is similar to Fillmore's theory of frame semantics. Langacker distinguishes two types of domains, locational and congurational; we argue that it is concepts in domains that are locational or congurational, not the domains themselves. We then analyze image schemas and show how they function like domains, in which are found both locational and congurational concepts.},

  abstract = {Metaphors pervade discussions of social issues like climate change, the economy, and crime. We ask how natural language metaphors shape the way people reason about such social issues. In previous work, we showed that describing crime metaphorically as a beast or a virus, led people to generate different solutions to a city’s crime problem. In the current series of studies, instead of asking people to generate a solution on their own, we provided them with a selection of possible solutions and asked them to choose the best ones. We found that metaphors influenced people’s reasoning even when they had a set of options available to compare and select among. These findings suggest that metaphors can influence not just what solution comes to mind first, but also which solution people think is best, even when given the opportunity to explicitly compare alternatives. Further, we tested whether participants were aware of the metaphor. We found that very few participants thought the metaphor played an important part in their decision. Further, participants who had no explicit memory of the metaphor were just as much affected by the metaphor as participants who were able to remember the metaphorical frame. These findings suggest that metaphors can act covertly in reasoning. Finally, we examined the role of political affiliation on reasoning about crime. The results confirm our previous findings that Republicans are more likely to generate enforcement and punishment solutions for dealing with crime, and are less swayed by metaphor than are Democrats or Independents.},

With quantitative growth has come qualitative diversification, and within a now heterogeneous field, different – and at times opposing – views on theoretical and methodological matters have emerged. The historical “prototype” of Cognitive Linguistics may be described as predominantly of mentalist persuasion, based on introspection, specialized in analysing language from a synchronic point of view, focused on West-European data (English in particular), and showing limited interest in the social and multimodal aspects of communication. Over the past years, many promising extensions from this prototype have emerged. The contributions selected for the Special Issue take stock of these extensions along the cognitive, social and methodological axes that expand the cognitive linguistic object of inquiry across time, space and modality.},

  abstract = {Although Cognitive Linguistics represents a recontextualization with respect to prior tradition, internally it has been diverse and grounded from the outset. In design and principle, this holds for Cognitive Grammar, which seeks a comprehensive yet unified account of structure and use. It foreshadowed the “social turn” by claiming that the speaker-hearer interaction is inherent in linguistic units, which are abstracted from usage events; and also the “quantitative turn”, by its usage-based nature and the view that structure resides in processing activity. There is no single way of describing a language, just as there is no single way of describing a biological organism. Linguistics is thus a vast, multifaceted enterprise embracing a wide range of objectives, methods, and expertise. A number of points are made in this regard. (i) While corpus analysis is essential for many purposes, elicited and introspective data also have their place. (ii) With no inconsistency, language is validly characterized as both a cognitive/mental phenomenon and a social/interactive one. (iii) The fact that language resides in processing activity does not entail the absence of discreteness or the non-existence of complex structures. (iv) The importance of quantitative methods does not obviate the central role of structural analysis and description, which have equal claim to being empirical.},

  abstract = {Cognitive Linguistics is an approach to language study based on three central premises: that the function of language is to convey meaning, that linguistic description must rely on constructs that are psychologically real, and that grammar emerges from usage. Over the last 40 years, this approach to studying language has made enormous strides in virtually every aspect of linguistic inquiry, achieving major insights as well as bringing about a conceptual unification of the language sciences. However, it has also faced problems, which, I argue, must be addressed if the approach is to continue to flourish. Some of these are shared with generative linguistics, while some are peculiar to the cognitive approach. The former include excessive reliance on introspective evidence; paying only lip service to the Cognitive Commitment; too much focus on hypothesis formulation (and not enough on hypothesis testing); ignoring individual differences; and neglecting the social aspects of language. The latter include assuming that we can deduce mental representations from patterns of use and equating distribution with meaning. I conclude by sketching out how these pitfalls could be avoided.},

These make it possible to take a quantitative approach, while generating and testing specific hypotheses that will advance our understanding of how knowledge of language emerges from exposure to usage.},

These issues are not only philosophical as they hold crucial implications for methodology. Here, I propose that most of them can be resolved with the help of phenomenology, “the study of human experience and of the ways things present themselves to us in and through such experience” (Sokolowski 2000. Introduction to phenomenology. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2). Cogent syntheses are proposed to the individual/social and prelinguistic/linguistic debates, showing that scholars like Langacker, Talmy and Itkonen have focused on complementary aspects of implicitly phenomenological investigations. Third-person, “objective” methods are necessary for extending the scope of such investigations, but epistemologically secondary. Thus, the focus of Cognitive Linguistics can be brought back to experience, albeit in a more mature manner than 30 years ago.},

  shorttitle = {Does Historical Linguistics Need the {{Cognitive Commitment}}?},
  abstract = {On the basis of a case study of the so-called jer shift in Slavic, I argue that the Cognitive Commitment is essential for an adequate analysis of language change. While the “social turn” and the “quantitative turn” open up important perspectives and provide new opportunities for cognitive historical linguistics, the Cognitive Commitment remains essential because it facilitates elegant and insightful analyses and paves the way for more general hypotheses about language change. The jer shift is a prosodic change that originated in Late Common Slavic and spread to Old East Slavic in the twelfth century. This sound change involved the lax vowels /ĭ, ŭ/ (often referred to as jers or yers), which either disappeared or merged with /e, o/ depending on the prosodic environment. Contrary to traditional practice, I argue that the jer shift should be analyzed in terms of trochaic feet, i. e., rhythmic groups of two syllables, where the leftmost syllable is prominent. This account is psychologically realistic, as dictated by the Cognitive Commitment, since rhythmic grouping is a fundamental property of human cognition (Nathan 2015. Phonology. In Ewa Dąbrowska \& Dagmar Divjak (eds.), Handbook of cognitive linguistics, 253–273. Berlin \& Boston: De Gruyter Mouton and Ding et al. 2016. Cortical tracking of hierarchical linguistic structures in connected speech. Nature Neuroscience 19. 158–164). While the Cognitive Commitment is essential for historical linguistics, one important limitation deserves mention. Historical changes such as the jer shift can be represented as “sound laws”, i. e., statements that summarize changes that span over many generations. Such statements are not about processes in the minds of individual speakers or speech communities at any point in time. They are therefore not directly relevant for the Cognitive Commitment, but are nevertheless among the most valuable tools historical linguists have at their disposal.},

This in turn requires the contribution of discourse analysis, sociolinguistics, and evolutionary historical linguistics as well as typology and Cognitive Linguistics.

In this paper we describe results from using a maximum entropy (ME) classifier to identify metaphors. Using the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpus, we annotated all the verbal targets associated with a set of frames which includes frames of spatial motion, manipulation, and health. One surprising finding was that over 90\% of annotated targets from these frames are used metaphorically, underscoring the importance of processing figurative language. We then used this labeled data and each verbal target's PropBank annotation to train a maximum entropy classifier to make this literal vs. metaphoric distinction. Using the classifier, we reduce the final error in the test set by 5\% over the verb-specific majority class baseline and 31\% over the corpus-wide majority class baseline.},

  abstract = {This study examines the usage and meanings of emotion-related body part terms that are found in metaphoric expressions. By using the data from electronic corpora of written and spoken languages, English head, heart, gut and leg parts and Japanese atama 'head', mune ‘chest’, hara ‘belly’ and ashi 'leg' are cross-culturally compared. The goal of this research is two-fold. One is to redefine the communicative function of metaphoric expressions that is conventionally considered peripheral. Another is to highlight potential ‘culture specific concepts’ by Lakoff and Johnson (1980) behind the metaphoric usages of the English and Japanese body part terms through a microscopic analysis of KWIC (keyword in context) search results. Research results show that English and Japanese associate different types of emotions/feelings with different parts of the body. For example, English places a center of self in the heart and Japanese places it at the gut. However, it appears that both English and Japanese commonly use Lakoff and Johnson’s (1980) ‘spatial orientation’ (e.g. up and down) to code one’s feelings/emotions in the body. My hypothesis is that the locations of the body parts play a role in representing different types of feelings. Specifically, I suggest that upper body represents controllable emotions and the lower body represents more primordial emotions and feelings such as anger and instinct.},

I then turn to American and European penal history to demonstrate that the invention of the prison was premised on the notion that solitary confinement could inculcate regret in prisoners and thereby change them profoundly.

Understanding how affects can revise both beliefs—under their committing aspect—and the order of desires, implies seeing the dynamics of affects as interacting with external dynamics and the order of priorities as a weak one (“pseudo-distance”; Schlechta, 2004).

  abstract = {Countless studies have reported that individuals detect threatening/angry faces faster than happy/neutral faces. Two classic views have been used to explain this phenomenon—that negative valence drives the effect, or conversely, that low-level perceptual characteristics of the stimuli are responsible for their rapid detection. In the current review, I question whether dichotomous perspectives are the most parsimonious way to explain a large and inconsistent literature. Further, I argue that nondichotomous, multicomponent accounts for the detection of emotionally valenced stimuli might help take us beyond traditional approaches to visual detection research, and I suggest various ways in which future research can use these newer approaches to more effectively elucidate the mechanisms underlying the rapid detection of emotionally valenced stimuli.},

To identify and organize skills associated with the recognition and knowledge of emotions, and to highlight the focus of emotion understanding as localized in the self, in specific others, and in generalized others, we introduce the conceptual framework of Emotion Understanding in Recognition and Knowledge Abilities (EUReKA). We then categorize 56 existing methods of emotion understanding within this framework to highlight current gaps and future opportunities in assessing emotion understanding across the lifespan. We hope the EUReKA model provides a systematic and integrated framework for conceptualizing and measuring emotion understanding for future research.},

The analysis raises questions about the context for and frequency of use of emotion metaphors and, indeed, emotion labels (e.g., “angry”), per se. An assumption implicit to most theories of emotion is that emotion language is just another channel through which people express ongoing emotion states. Drawing from recent evidence that labeling ongoing emotions reduces their intensity, we propose that a primary function of emotion language is regulatory rather than expressive.},

  abstract = {Approaches to language processing have traditionally been formulated with reference to general cognitive concepts (e.g. working memory limitations) or have based their representational assumptions on concepts from generative linguistic theory (e.g. structure determines interpretation). Thus, many well-established generalisations about language that have emerged from cross-linguistic/typological research have not as yet had a major influence in shaping ideas about online processing. Here, we examine the viability of using typologically motivated concepts to account for phenomena in online language comprehension. In particular, we focus on the comprehension of simple transitive sentences (i.e. sentences involving two arguments/event participants) and cross-linguistic similarities and differences in how they are processed. We argue that incremental argument interpretation in these structures is best explained with reference to a range of cross-linguistically motivated, hierarchically ordered information types termed ‘prominence scales’ (e.g. animacy, definiteness/specificity, case marking and linear order). We show that the assumption of prominence-based argument processing can capture a wide range of recent neurocognitive findings, as well as deriving well-known behavioural results.},

  shorttitle = {The {{Conceptualization}} of {{Emotion Events}} in {{Three Formosan Languages}}},
  abstract = {An important issue in the study of the language of emotion language, from a cognitive perspective, is to investigate how language conceptualizes emotions. Since the 1980s, linguists have been exploring how abstract concepts may be based on conceptual metaphors for bodily, physical concepts. However, conceptual metaphors have been shown not to be a universally preferred strategy in conceptualizing emotion events. Nevertheless, the factor influencing the selectionof metaphorical strategies is underexplored and opaque. This study thus sets out to accomplish two goals. First, I postulate that limitation on the linguistic mechanism, namely, nominalization of emotion terms, may constrain language users’ selection of metaphorical strategies in conceptualizing emotion events. My results show that languages having emotion nouns are found to have comparatively rich metaphorical expressions for emotions. To the contrary, in the languages where the linguistic mechanism to encode abstract emotion concepts is inadequate or unavailable, the metaphorical strategy is dispreferred. Second, as emotion events are inherently events of causality, and are characterized by deploying event participants, I examine how grammatical constructions, that is, recurrent syntactic patterns with their associated functions, are made available by the conventional resources of a language, and I investigate how language users in their daily communication conceptualize emotion events and portray participant relations by choosing different grammatical constructions.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates syntactic productivity in diachrony with a data-driven approach. Previous research indicates that syntactic productivity (the property of grammatical constructions to attract new lexical fillers) is largely driven by semantics, which calls for an operationalization of lexical meaning in the context of empirical studies. It is suggested that distributional semantics can fulfill this role by providing a measure of semantic similarity between words that is derived from lexical co-occurrences in large text corpora. On the basis of a case study of the construction “V the hell out of NP”, e.g., You scared the hell out of me, it is shown that distributional semantics not only appropriately captures how the verbs in the distribution of the construction are related, but also enables the use of visualization techniques and statistical modeling to analyze the semantic development of a construction over time and identify the determinants of syntactic productivity in naturally occurring data.},

The paper concentrates on passages involving causation, as causal relationships are considered by many to exhibit the most salient differences in rhetorical preference between the two languages.},

And if languages do not affect thought, why do bilinguals often perceive such influence?

Bilinguals were either excluded from this research as 'unusual' or 'messy' subjects, or treated as representative speakers of their first languages. Only recently did bi- and multilinguals become research participants in their own right. Pavlenko considers the socio-political circumstances that led to the monolingual status quo and shows how the invisibility of bilingual participants compromised the validity and reliability of findings in the study of language and cognition. She then shifts attention to the bilingual turn in the field and examines its contributions to the understanding of the human mind.},

  abstract = {"This book reports on the contrastive-semantic investigation of sadness expressions between English and Chinese, based on two monolingual general corpora and a parallel corpus. The exploration adopts a unique theoretical approach which integrates corpus-linguistic theories on meaning (as a social construct, usage and paraphrase) with a corpus-linguistic lexical model. It employs a new complex but workable methodology which combines computational tools with manual examination to tease meaning out of corpus evidence, to compare and contrast lexical items that do not match up neatly between languages. It looks at sadness expressions both within and across languages in terms of three corpus-linguistic structural categories, i.e. colligation, collocation and semantic association/preference, and paraphrase (both explicit and implicit) to capture their subtle nuances of meaning, disclose the culture-specific conceptualisations encoded in them, and highlight their respective cultural distinctiveness of emotion. By presenting multidisciplinary original work, Sadness Expressions in English and Chinese will be of interest to researchers in corpus linguistics, contrastive lexical semantics, psychology, bilingual lexicography and language pedagogy"--},

  abstract = {Understanding how words change their meanings over time is key to models of language and cultural evolution, but historical data on meaning is scarce, making theories hard to develop and test. Word embeddings show promise as a diachronic tool, but have not been carefully evaluated. We develop a robust methodology for quantifying semantic change by evaluating word embeddings (PPMI, SVD, word2vec) against known historical changes. We then use this methodology to reveal statistical laws of semantic evolution. Using six historical corpora spanning four languages and two centuries, we propose two quantitative laws of semantic change: (i) the law of conformity---the rate of semantic change scales with an inverse power-law of word frequency; (ii) the law of innovation---independent of frequency, words that are more polysemous have higher rates of semantic change.},

  abstract = {This article reviews some of the foundational assumptions of Croft'sRadical Construction Grammar. While constructions have featured prominently in much recent work in cognitive linguistics, Croft adopts the ‘radical’ view that constructions are the primary objects of linguistic analysis, with lexical and syntactic categories being defined with respect to the constructions in which they occur. This approach reverses the traditional view, according to which complex expressions are compositionally assembled through syntactic rules operating over items selected from the lexicon. The ubiquity of idioms, especially so-called constructional idioms, provides compelling evidence for the essential correctness of the radical constructional view. The possibility of a radical constructional approach to phonology is also discussed},

  abstract = {Although often a painful and prolonged process, conjugating verbs correctly is essential when you try to master a foreign language. Verbs that exhibit an irregular conjugation paradigm, however, are often the verbs that occur most frequently in a language. The nature of inflectional morphemes and the mechanism for conjugating verbs have been the topic of debate for 25 years now. This has led to many different accounts of the problem, both in the field of descriptive linguistics as well as in a range of modeling approaches. The field of Construction Grammar has recently witnessed the theoretical work on Construction Morphology by Geert Booij (2010), but there has been no computational implementation that could test the theory on a large scale. Using the framework of Fluid Construction Grammar (FCG), I investigate the grammar and morphological constructions that are needed to automatically conjugate the full paradigms of the 600 most frequently used verbs in Spanish. This paper reports a fully operational rule-based implementation of such a grammar and goes into the details of the constructions that support it. The results also show that morphological constructions are exemplary constructions since they combine two (or more) units (a stem and a suffix(es)) into a single meaningful unit (a conjugated verb form) that can be picked up by other discourse elements. Extensions towards embedding the conjugation constructions into a bigger grammar or automatically learning new morphological constructions remain the focus of future work.},

Recently, there have been exciting developments to cater for this demand, most notably in Sign-Based Construction Grammar (SBCG) and Fluid Construction Grammar (FCG). Unfortunately, like playing a music instrument, the formalisms used by SBCG and FCG take time and effort to master, and linguists who are unfamiliar with them may not always appreciate the far-reaching theoretical consequences of adopting this or that approach. This paper undresses SBCG and FCG to their bare essentials, and offers a linguist-friendly comparison that looks at how both approaches define constructions, linguistic knowledge and language processing.},

  title = {A Classification of the Semantic Field Good and Evil in the Vocabulary of {{English}}},
  url = {http://encore.lib.gla.ac.uk/iii/encore/record/C__Rb1373020},
  abstract = {The central part of this thesis (chapter 3) consists of a classification of 9071 lexical items comprising the semantic field Good and Evil. This classified semantic field, with minor alterations, will form part of the Historical Thesaurus of English currently being compiled in the English Language Department of Glasgow University. Some significant features of the Good and Evil classification system, devised and explained in this thesis, have also been adopted by the Historical Thesaurus.

Chapter 1 places the thesis in a wider academic context. It explains briefly the Historical Thesaurus project, and describes how the classification of Good and Evil contributes to this. It also relates the thesis to linguistics, semantics, and especially to semantic theory, lexicography, and semantic classification.

Chapter 2 defines the semantic field Good and Evil and discusses how the field was assembled. It provides details of those areas which were either rejected or extended in order to form the semantic field. It then describes in some detail the classification system devised for Good and Evil. The structure of the classification is explained, the use of the parts of speech as a valuable classificatory device is justified, and the contribution of other classificatory work is acknowledged. The chapter also discusses some particular problems and features of the Old English corpus. It ends with lists of stylistic and other conventions.

Chapter 3 contains the Good and Evil classification, and chapter 4 consists of detailed notes on the classification. These notes discuss points relating to dating. Old English material, classificatory devices, closely connected categories, and some problems of dictionary definitions, among other things. Chapter 5 conducts a number of studies based on historical and etymological information drawn from the classification. The relative numbers of accessions and losses in different centuries in the categories are presented and discussed. The range of sources of origin of a limited number of categories arc detailed. The patterns of change, and the extent and rate of influence of different languages in different centuries, are then commented on and compared.

Chapter 6 selects one area of vocabulary from Good and Evil - animal names used as names for people - and subjects this area to a detailed examination. The variety of animal names, and the range of people to whom

they arc applied, arc discussed, and various statistics and comparisons arc drawn up. Also considered is the time gap between the first literal use of an animal name and the first figurative or metaphorical application of the same term to a person. In the process some interesting and, on occasion, unproven points about animal metaphor are brought to light. The thesis ends with three appendices. The first contains extra Good and Evil material not in the main classification, the second details 19th century obsolescences, and the third gives a numerical distribution of items in each category by part of speech},

  abstract = {This paper deals with the analysis of sports discourse in Croatian through the theoretical framework offered by conceptual metaphor theory. Within this framework, certain metaphorical expressions found in sports discourse are analyzed as expressions of two conceptual metaphors: sport is war and sport is force. The analysis of these metaphorical expressions combines the methodology of cognitive linguistics with corpus linguistics, resulting in the proposal of a new method for discourse analysis in general. In our research, we introduce the notion of the specialized digitized corpus as a basis for further quantitative and qualitative research. On the basis of the specialized digitized corpus created for the purposes of this research, it is shown how the formation of sports discourse is dependent on three categories of metaphorical expressions relative to the degree of their conventionalization within sports discourse: (a) conventionalized, (b) semi-conventionalized, and (c) innovative metaphorical expressions. Each of these categories is analyzed according to their frequency and various aspects of meaning that it entails. Through the introduction of the semi-conventionalized metaphorical expression category, we aim to examine the gradable line between language creativity and conventionality as it is formed within the discourse of sports.},

  title = {Construction {{Morphology}}},
  doi = {10.1093/acrefore/9780199384655.013.254},
  abstract = {Construction Morphology is a theory of word structure in which the complex words of a language are analyzed as constructions, that is, systematic pairings of form and meaning. These pairings are analyzed within a Tripartite Parallel Architecture conception of grammar. This presupposes a word-based approach to the analysis of morphological structure and a strong dependence on paradigmatic relations between words. The lexicon contains both words and the constructional schemas they are instantiations of. Words and schemas are organized in a hierarchical network, with intermediate layers of subschemas. These schemas have a motivating function with respect to existing complex words and specify how new complex words can be formed.The consequence of this view of morphology is that there is no sharp boundary between lexicon and grammar. In addition, the use of morphological patterns may also depend on specific syntactic constructions (construction-dependent morphology).This theory of lexical relatedness also provides insight into language change such as the use of obsolete case markers as markers of specific constructions, the change of words into affixes, and the debonding of word constituents into independent words. Studies of language acquisition and word processing confirm this view of the lexicon and the nature of lexical knowledge.Construction Morphology is also well equipped for dealing with inflection and the relationships between the cells of inflectional paradigms, because it can express how morphological schemas are related paradigmatically.},

MorphInd outputs the analysis in the form of segmented morphemes along with the morphological tags. The implementation was done using finite state technology by adopting the two-level morphology approach implemented in Foma. It achieved 84.6\% of coverage on a preliminary stage Indonesian corpus where it mostly fails to capture the proper nouns and foreign words as expected initially.},

  abstract = {Just like its English counterpart (cf. Goldberg 1995), the Dutch double object construction is a prime example of a highly polysemous argument structure construction, with a basic ‘X causes Y to receive Z’ sense and several extended meanings which depart from the prototype in various respects and to varying degrees. This paper provides a corpus-based overview of the semantic structure of this construction, following the multidimensional approach to constructional semantics advocated in Geeraerts (1998). On the basis of Stefanowitsch \& Gries’s (2003) “collexeme analysis” method, we will identify the verbs which most typically realize the investigated construction in a one-million-word newspaper corpus. These verbs will be shown to instantiate extensions along various dimensions of semantic variation. Several ofthese semantic extensions are paralleled in English, while others are not.},

  abstract = {Framing is an important concept in communication, yet many framing studies set out to develop frames relevant to only one issue. We expand framing theory by introducing figurative framing. We posit that figurative language types like metaphor, hyperbole and irony are important in shaping public discourse, because these figures contain important linguistic and conceptual content about the issue under discussion. We first explicate the role of each individual figure (metaphor, hyperbole, and irony) in the framing of important societal issues. Then, we focus on complex figurative frames (combinations of metaphor, hyperbole, and/or irony). The article concludes with a research agenda, connecting figurative framing to the four key processes in framing research (frame building, frame setting, individual‐level effects, and feedback loop).},

We start by comparing existing definitions of linguistic hyperbole. Based on the commonalities shared by these definitions, we provide our operational definition of hyperbole as “an expression that is more extreme than justified given its ontological referent.” The next section argues why it is useful to identify hyperbole, as with metaphor in Metaphor Identification Procedure Vrije Universiteit (MIPVU), at the level of lexical units, and subsequently introduces the steps of HIP. We follow up with two sample analyses of HIP in practice. First, we show how to unitize and analyze one complete sample sentence. Second, we present sample analyses of a number of selected cases. Then we present data showing that HIP can be reliably applied to a sample corpus of Dutch news texts. We end with discussing applications and implications of using HIP in corpus research.},

The current article reports a systematic literature review (N = 109) that examines whether these approaches report converging or diverging effects. We compared CDA and REA on the metaphorical frames that were studied and their reported effects. Results show that the CDA frames are typically more negative, nonfictional, and extreme than REA frames. Reported effects in CDA and REA studies differ in terms of presence, directionality, and strength, with CDA typically reporting strong effects in line with the frame, compared to REA. These differences in effects can be (partly) explained by the different frame characteristics. However, differences in the methods applied by CDA and REA could be (partly) responsible for these differences as well. In all, we conclude that the research field is fragmented on the impact of metaphors in politics.},

(2) What counts as a metaphor in thought, including thought about knowledge? The answers to these questions capture some of the latest discussions in linguistic metaphor research, which can help increase the quality of further research on metaphor in knowledge management.

  abstract = {Different signals, or tuning devices, in language, including certain discourse markers, comparatives, intensifiers and semantic meta-language, sometimes accompany verbal metaphors. Some scholars have claimed that these signals give evidence of “deliberate metaphor” use on the part of speakers and writers. So, understanding these particular uses of metaphor requires people to infer deliberation, which leads them to pay greater notice to these figures and enhances their understanding of the cross-domain mappings motivating metaphorical utterances. Many linguistic analyses argue that deliberate metaphor is a critical part of metaphor use, yet no empirical study has explored whether people really infer greater deliberation and cross-domain mappings when encountering so-called pragmatic signals of metaphor. The present study tested this idea and did not find evidence in support of the deliberate metaphor proposal. This conclusion raises serious doubts about the psychological validity of the idea that some metaphors are produced and understood as being deliberate.},

However, syntagmatic meaning and coding interact in a complex way with paradigmatic structures such as lets, metonymy, and metaphor. How can Construction Grammar capture the formal and semantic structure of entrenched schematic constructions while rigorously accounting for all these parameters? Based on the analysis of the conceptual domain of `stealing' in English, this study demonstrates that through combining three different approaches to linguistic structure, the study of the semantic frame, the cognitive model, and the onomasiological lexical field, we can more properly appreciate and explain lexical, metaphoric, and constructional interplay.},

  abstract = {Most previous linguistic investigations of the web have focused on special linguistic features associated with Internet language (e.g., the use of emoticons, abbreviations, contractions, and acronyms) and the “new” Internet registers that are especially salient to observers (e.g., blogs, Internet forums, instant messages, tweets). Multi-Dimensional (MD) analysis has also been used to analyze Internet registers, focusing on core grammatical features (e.g., nouns, verbs, prepositional phrases). MD research differs theoretically and methodologically from most other research approaches in linguistics in that it is built on the notion of linguistic co-occurrence, with the claim that register differences are best described in terms of sets of co-occurring linguistic features that have a functional underpinning. At the same time, though, most previous MD studies are similar to other previous research in their focus on new Internet registers, such as blogs, Facebook/Twitter posts, and email messages. These are the registers that we immediately think of in association with the Internet, and thus it makes sense that they should be the focus of most previous research. However, that emphasis means that we know surprisingly little at present about the full range of registers found on the web and the patterns of linguistic variation among those registers. This is the goal of the present study. Rather than beginning with a focus on new registers that are assumed to be interesting, we analyze a representative sample of the entire searchable web. End-users coded the situational and communicative characteristics of each document in our corpus, leading to a much wider range of register categories than that used in any previous linguistic study: eight general categories; several hybrid register categories; and twenty-seven specific register categories. This approach thus leads to a much more inclusive and diverse sample of web registers than that found in any previous study of English Internet language. The goal of the present study is to document the patterns of linguistic variation among those registers. Using MD analysis, we explore the dimensions of linguistic variation on the searchable web, and the similarities and differences among web registers with respect to those dimensions.},

  url = {https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/31444},
  shorttitle = {Semantic Role Alignment in Metaphor},
  abstract = {Metaphor occurs when a word or phrase is used in a way that conflicts with its usual (literal) meaning, so that part of its meaning is applied to a different semantic domain. For example, time is construed as money in “This gadget will save you hours” (Lakoff and Johnson 1980). There is a link between the concepts time and money that underlies many expressions in English; this is therefore considered a conceptual metaphor. Conceptual Metaphor Theory (CMT) has dominated metaphor research since Lakoff and Johnson (1980), but researchers (e.g. Croft 2009, Sullivan 2013) are turning to other cognitive linguistic theories such as Frame Semantics (Fillmore 1982) and Cognitive Grammar (Langacker 1987) to rectify the problems inherent in that approach. CMT does not provide tools for systematically defining metaphoric concepts and their components, which prevents the analysis of metaphor’s internal meaning. It views metaphor as a superimposition of meaning from one domain (e.g. money above) onto another (e.g. time). Corpus data has improved metaphor research methods, but sounder methodology is needed to choose which metaphors to study. This dissertation takes a novel approach to metaphor in that the data are taken from a semantically annotated corpus where their semantic domains are already assigned. The main dataset is comprised of a naturally occurring group of related metaphors that construe awareness as perception. Using the notion of frame from Frame Semantics (Fillmore 1982) as implemented in the lexicographic database FrameNet (Atkins et al. 2003) to define semantic domains and their internal components (frame elements; similar to semantic roles), this dissertation analyzes metaphors from the frame-semantically annotated database of German, SALSA (Burchardt et al. 2006, 2009), to investigate how meaning elements (semantic roles) from the metaphor’s two semantic domains align. I show that semantic roles align consistently, although not every semantic role has a counterpart in the other domain. I argue that the use of semantic and syntactic information that is associated with one domain but not the other allows emergent meaning to be created in metaphor. The analysis supports the view of metaphor as a blended space, independent of either semantic domain, as described by Fauconnier and Turner (2002).},

I argue that one (also used to negate nominal predicates) is a marker of ‘external’ (sentential) negation, while the other is a marker of ‘internal’ (predicate) negation. This contrast is demonstrated by striking differences in syntactic distribution and scopal properties. In verbal clauses the marker of predicate negation is the default, while the marker of sentential negation is allowed only in certain pragmatically determined contexts. These contexts include: (i) contrastive sentences, (ii) marked narrow focus, and (iii) metalinguistic negation. External negation in Malay is restricted to ‘root clauses’; I suggest that this is due to its echoic character.},

It is argued that the identity marking CMC interactants develop has to be stronger, more salient, and, possibly less ambiguous than that used in direct conversation and that the emotionality markers the users apply in their discussion, particularly those engaging negative emotions and reflecting negative judgments, are argued to be used by online discussants for the purpose of increasing the CMC commentators’ conversational visibility. The questions of cultural and linguistic divergence between English and Polish emotional communication patterns are the main points discussed. Three sets of corpus materials are used and the research methodology involves both the qualitative analysis of the emotion types as well as a quantitative (frequency) approach, particularly with respect to culture-specific corpus-generated collocation patterns.$<$/p$>$},

The possibilities of being a relatively late cultural loan and a direct influence of the humoral theory were both rejected, because of the discovered abundance of semi-schematic patterns and the lack of prominence of patterns related to the specific motion of body fluids. The universalistic account of bodily experience was considered to be the most powerful available explanation. The generalised embodied understanding of emotion in terms of motion was revealed by (a) the rich variety of conceptual metaphors and metonymies that were used (often simultaneously), and (b) how well they fit into the three-stage cognitive model of a typical emotion scenario. Gradual deliteralization of the verbs’ meanings is also a plausible mechanism at work because the semantic abstractness of a motion verb was found to be a function of the nature of the entities filling the slots in the semi-schematic patterns.$<$/p$>$},

  abstract = {More than 50 years ago, John Tukey called for a reformation of academic statistics. In “The Future of Data Analysis,” he pointed to the existence of an as-yet unrecognized science, whose subject of interest was learning from data, or “data analysis.” Ten to 20 years ago, John Chambers, Jeff Wu, Bill Cleveland, and Leo Breiman independently once again urged academic statistics to expand its boundaries beyond the classical domain of theoretical statistics; Chambers called for more emphasis on data preparation and presentation rather than statistical modeling; and Breiman called for emphasis on prediction rather than inference. Cleveland and Wu even suggested the catchy name “data science” for this envisioned field. A recent and growing phenomenon has been the emergence of “data science” programs at major universities, including UC Berkeley, NYU, MIT, and most prominently, the University of Michigan, which in September 2015 announced a \$100M “Data Science Initiative” that aims to hire 35 new faculty. Teaching in these new programs has significant overlap in curricular subject matter with traditional statistics courses; yet many academic statisticians perceive the new programs as “cultural appropriation.” This article reviews some ingredients of the current “data science moment,” including recent commentary about data science in the popular media, and about how/whether data science is really different from statistics. The now-contemplated field of data science amounts to a superset of the fields of statistics and machine learning, which adds some technology for “scaling up” to “big data.” This chosen superset is motivated by commercial rather than intellectual developments. Choosing in this way is likely to miss out on the really important intellectual event of the next 50 years. Because all of science itself will soon become data that can be mined, the imminent revolution in data science is not about mere “scaling up,” but instead the emergence of scientific studies of data analysis science-wide. In the future, we will be able to predict how a proposal to change data analysis workflows would impact the validity of data analysis across all of science, even predicting the impacts field-by-field. Drawing on work by Tukey, Cleveland, Chambers, and Breiman, I present a vision of data science based on the activities of people who are “learning from data,” and I describe an academic field dedicated to improving that activity in an evidence-based manner. This new field is a better academic enlargement of statistics and machine learning than today’s data science initiatives, while being able to accommodate the same short-term goals.

By contrast, we investigate the syntagmatic relation between words in adjective-noun and noun-noun combinations and present a new experimental design for measuring the strength of human associations. Of particular importance for syntagmatic relations are asymmetric associations, whose associational strength is much larger in one direction (e.g., from Pyrrhic to victory) than in the other (e.g., from victory to Pyrrhic). We develop a number of corpus-derived measures of asymmetric association and show that they predict the directedness of human associations with high accuracy.},

It investigates effects upon naturalistic second language acquisition of type/token distributions in the islands comprising the linguistic form of English verb-argument constructions (VACs: VL verb locative, VOL verb object locative, VOO ditransitive) in the ESF corpus (Perdue, 1993). Goldberg (2006) argued that Zipfian type/token frequency distribution of verbs in natural language might optimize construction learning by providing one very high frequency exemplar that is also prototypical in meaning. Ellis \&amp; Ferreira-Junior (2009) confirmed that in the naturalistic L2A of English, VAC verb type/token distribution in the input is Zipfian and learners first acquire the most frequent, prototypical and generic exemplar (e.g. put in VOL, give in VOO, etc.). This paper further illustrates how acquisition is affected by the frequency and frequency distribution of exemplars within each island of the construction (e.g. [Subj V Obj Oblpath/loc]), by their prototypicality, and, using a variety of psychological and corpus linguistic association metrics, by their contingency of form-function mapping.},

The paper describes the types of situation where cognition deviates from rationality and it introduces how the apparent irrationalities of L2 acquisition result from standard phenomena of associative learning as encapsulated in the models of Rescorla and Wagner (1972) and Cheng and Holyoak (1995), which describe how cue salience, outcome importance, and the history of learning from multiple probabilistic cues affect the development of ‘learned selective attention’ and transfer.},

  abstract = {This paper is a position statement on reproducible research in linguistics, including data citation and attribution, that represents the collective views of some 41 colleagues. Reproducibility can play a key role in increasing verification and accountability in linguistic research, and is a hallmark of social science research that is currently under-represented in our field. We believe that we need to take time as a discipline to clearly articulate our expectations for how linguistic data are managed, cited, and maintained for long-term access.},
